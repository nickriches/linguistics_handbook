<p>I have created these notes using a platform called <code>mkdocs</code> which adds a couple of useful features.</p>
<p>Firstly, the <strong>search capabilities</strong> are really good. If you press <code>s</code> on your computer a search bar will appear. Type anything into it, e.g. <code>preposition</code> or <code>lemma</code> and it will quickly find the location where these topics are covered. This should be useful for revision.</p>
<p>Secondly, it contains a useful feature called a <strong>permalink</strong>. If you hover next to a heading, you will see a RETURN character (&#182;). Click on this, and the heading will move to the top of the screen. You will notice that the "url" (i.e. the address in the address  bar at the top of your browser) has changed. You can copy this address, and paste it into the app you are using to take your notes in (that is, if you are using an app, rather than pen and paper). Whenever, you want to quickly access the notes, just click on the link, and it will take you to the relevant location in the notes.</p>

<p>There is substantial research indicating that we learn best when we continually test our knowledge of a topic (Karpicke et al., 2009; Roediger &amp; Karpicke, 2006). This effect is called the “testing effect”, and a learning strategy which depends on continually testing yourself is called “test-enhanced” learning. Amazingly, there is good evidence that the very act of testing yourself is beneficial, even if you do not successfully recall the relevant information (Kornell et al., 2015; Kornell &amp; Vaughn, 2016; Vaughn et al., 2017). This is pretty extraordinary and suggests that time spent studying at your desk is never wasted, even if you are struggling to recall the material.</p>
<p>The way that you test yourself depends on the material you are learning. For example, if testing new words in a foreign language you could have a card with the word in your first language (e.g. English) on one side, and the word in the target language (e.g. French) on the other side. You can work your way through the pack, read the English word, try to recall the French word, and test your knowledge by turning over the card. You could also do this process in reverse, e.g. look at the French word, and try to translate this into English.</p>
<p>The more active we are in the way we test ourselves, the better we learn and retain the information. Regarding the flashcard example above, the more active form of learning is to read the English word, and try to recall the French word. However, though the alternative process, translating from French to English is less active, it may be beneficial in certain contexts, e.g. for quick revision.</p>
<p>Some forms of learning are much more abstract not amenable to flashcards. An example of this is your understanding of the word class Noun. You could revise this in a variety of ways, e.g.</p>
<p>-    Provide a <strong>definition</strong>, but with a word missing, e.g.</p>
<p><code>A Noun is word which often refers to a ___ (thing). It is often preceded by a ___ (Determiner)</code></p>
<p>-    Create a <strong>multiple choice question</strong>, e.g. In the following sentence, which of the following properties does not describe a Noun</p>
<ul>
<li>It takes the suffix -ing &#10004;</li>
<li>It takes the suffix -s (in the regular form)</li>
<li>It is often prceded by a detrminer</li>
</ul>
<p>-    Create an <strong>open-ended “list” question</strong>, e.g. “List three properties of a Noun” (Possible answers: it tends to refer to a thing, it inflects for plural, e.g. <em>horses</em>, it comes after a determiner, e.g. <em>the horse</em>, it “agrees” with a verb, e.g. <em>the horse runs, the horses run_</em> etc.)</p>
<p>-    Create a <strong>completely open-ended question</strong>, e.g. “What is a definition of a noun”?</p>
<p>Which of these you think promotes more active learning? Evidence suggests that the more open-ended questions lead to better learning because they involve active recall of the material rather than recognition of the right answer (Kang et al., 2007). This doesn’t mean that multiple-choice questions are bad for study – they can be very beneficial. For example, there are clear right or wrong answers, unlike open-ended questions, and this can help you decide whether you need to revise a particular topic. They are also less time-consuming than open-ended questions. A good revision strategy would probably contain a mix of different types of revision prompts, e.g. flashcards, multiple-choice questions, open-ended list questions, and completely open-ended questions.</p>

<p>Words are concrete and easy to test using flashcard systems. For other kinds of knowledge, e.g. abstract theories, flashcards are too crude and simplistic, so you’ll need to find other ways to test yourself. For example, you could write the key claims of the theory on a piece of paper, number these, and using the numbers as prompts try to recall each claim one by one. This kind of works, but it is clear that the more abstract and complex a knowledge domain becomes, the more difficult it is to think of ways to test yourself.</p>
<p>While you are thinking about clever procedures to test yourself on everything you need to know, just start taking some notes. Take a blank sheet of paper, or open up a note-taking app, and try to recall everything you need to know in note form. By taking notes you are having to actively recall and process the information you have learnt. For example, because you are incapable of rapidly writing down everything the lecturer says (unless you are a word-record typist or short-hand expert), you are having to identify the most important points when notetaking. Also, because human memory for linguistic form is generally weaker than our memory for linguistic meaning, you will have to write down the main points of the lecture in your own words, and in this way you are having to actively process the information.</p>
<p>An additional benefit of note-taking is that you can easily show the structure of the material you are learning using headings and subheadings. All of the material you learn will have some kind of structure, e.g. a theory might consist of three key arguments, and the ICF clinical framework consists of four areas of functioning. Lectures themselves will be organised into discrete sections. Moreover, there is evidence to suggest that information is more adequately processed and retained when it is explicitly integrated into a larger structure. For example the regular use of headings and subheadings in written passages helps the reader to read more quickly and accurately, and recall more information (Hyönä &amp; Lorch, 2004; Lorch &amp; Lorch, 1996; Sanchez et al., 2001).</p>
<p>However, while the information you are given fits into an overarching structure, the technology which is used to deliver lectures is not great for showing structure. Powerpoint does not show structure very well, as it invites the user to create a continuous chain of slides. Sometimes lecturers add “Table of Contents” slides, but this is not that widely practised. By making notes you can actually impose structure on the material you are learning, using headings and subheadings, and this will help you to learn that material.</p>

<p>A good tried and tested note-taking system is called “Cornell Notes”, which was devised by  Prof. Walter Pauk of Cornell University in the 1950s. If you do an internet search you will find loads of materials on this approach. Here is one <a href="https://medium.goodnotes.com/study-with-ease-the-best-way-to-take-notes-2749a3e8297b">link</a> to start you off.</p>
<h2 id="how_to_learn-why-writing-notes-on-slides-may-not-be-helpful">Why writing notes on slides may not be helpful<a class="headerlink" href="#how_to_learn-why-writing-notes-on-slides-may-not-be-helpful" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Lecturers often supply their students with handouts containing the slides. Many students write on these handouts, and believe that this is an appropriate way to learn. But what is the evidence that this is a good learning approach? Existing studies investigating the impact of slide-based handouts have found that students learn better without them (Kim, 2018; Worthington &amp; Levasseur, 2015).</p>
<p>Why might this be the case? Firstly, if the slides contain a substantial amount of text, you are less likely to convert what you have learnt into your own words. Your notes will become shorter. They will become comments on the slides, rather than a full paraphrase of what you have just heard. Consequently, you will be learning in a more passive manner. Secondly, as mentioned above, it is quite difficult to signpost structure within slides. By contrast, if you make notes on a blank piece of paper it is easier to show structure by writing your own subheadings.</p>

<p>Yes, good note-taking is the place to start, but you also need to explore other ways to test yourself. As mentioned, flashcards may be very useful. For example, for anatomy, you could have a picture of a part of the body on one side, and the label on the other. You can look at the picture, and then attempt to recall the label. If you are correct, put it in the correct pile, and if you are incorrect, or cannot recall it, put it in the incorrect pile. There is quite interesting evidence to suggest that if you correctly recall something once, you are likely to recall it successfully in the future (Bahrick et al., 1993). Therefore, you can learn very efficiently just by repeatedly testing yourself on the items in the incorrect pile. Also, make sure that, when you test yourself, you do it at fairly widely-spaced intervals. This principle is known as “distributed learning” or the “spacing effect”, and there is a lot of evidence that it is beneficial for learning in an academic setting (Dempster, 1988).</p>
<p>Naturally, flashcards are only amenable to certain kinds of topics. For more abstract topics (e.g. Linguistics, Psychology), and you will need to find other ways to test yourself, e.g. by creating your own questions / prompts.</p>

<p><strong>OneNote</strong> – this has the advantage that it integrates well with other Microsoft products, e.g. emailing, calendar, and Teams</p>
<p><strong>Notion</strong> (https://www.notion.so) – possibly the most widely used non-Microsoft note-taking app. It’s also great as a general organisational app. Its basic plan is free.</p>
<p><strong>Roam Research</strong> (https://roamresearch.com) – High-concept, and slightly geeky app, frequently touted as “the next big thing”. It’s online only, and expensive, but students can get free plans.</p>
<p><strong>Evernote</strong> (https://evernote.com) – Simple app, which works both online and locally</p>
<p><strong>Apple Notes</strong> - If you are an Apple afficionado.</p>

<p><strong>Quizlet</strong> (https://quizlet.com/en-gb) – online flashcard app.</p>
<p><strong>Anki</strong> (https://apps.ankiweb.net) – open source cross-platform flashcard app. It has a bit of a steep learning curve.</p>

<p>These are technologies which incorporate note-taking and flashcards in a single app. The idea is that you can use them to take notes, and quickly generate flashcards to test yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Remnote</strong> (https://www.remnote.com) – Very user-friendly, online but also with a local app. It is explicitly designed for students. However, make sure you regularly back up your data to your local computer and don’t leave it sitting in the cloud (Remnote provides an easy way to do this).</p>
<p><strong>Obsidian</strong> - (https://obsidian.md) - Very popular note-taking app with revision features incorporated via plugins.</p>
<p><strong>Logseq</strong> (https://logseq.com) – Wonderful open-source notetaking and general organisational app. However, the learning curve is steeper than remnote. A big advantage is that you have complete ownership of your data.</p>
<p><strong>Roam Research</strong> – As mentioned above. Roam also has good tools for creating question banks.</p>

<p>While it is tempting to think in neat subfields, many phenomena cross over</p>
<p>e.g. The meaning of verbs (semantics) determines the number of participants in a sentence, which in turn determines the structure (syntax).</p>
<ol>
<li>John [1] <strong>gave</strong> Mary [2] a book [3]</li>
</ol>
<p>Because of these cross-over phenomena, linguists often talk about the 'interfaces' between the different subdomains, e.g. the syntax-semantic interface.</p>

<p><strong>Theoretical linguistics</strong>: investigates the nature of linguistic knowledge. IMPORTANT QUESTIONS: Are we born with knowledge of language? How do we explain similarities and differences across languages?</p>
<p><strong>Psycholinguistics</strong>: investigates how we comprehend and produce language. IMPORTANT QUESTIONS: Is the human mind similar to desktop computer? Does the language we speak affect the way we think?</p>
<p><strong>Sociolinguistics</strong>: investigates how and why language varies across different social classes and groupings. E.g. William Labov's famous (1963) study of Martha's Vinyard. He studies centralisation of diphthongs (multi-sound vowels). He pioneered methods to elicit relevant words without using word lists. He found an association between self-identification as a native and use of centralisation. Centralisation increased in response to an influx of non-natives. This shows that the language we use "indexes" our social identity.</p>

<p>Prescriptive judgements regarding language usage are periodically proposed by influential individuals. Key targets of prescriptive judgements are the double negative and use of <em>innit</em> as a tage question. Linguists would not regard either of these forms as "bad" English. The key thing is that they are (a) shared among a speech community (b) adequately convey a message, i.e. do not lead to ambiguity and misunderstanding.</p>
<p>(1) <strong>Double negative</strong>: I haven't got no money / I can't get no satisfaction</p>
<p>Acceptable in certain dialects (e.g. London English) and languages (e.g. Spanish). It does not cause confusion as many prescriptivists claim.</p>
<p>(2) Use of <strong>innit</strong> as a tag question</p>
<ol>
<li>It was a great meal, <em>wasn't it</em> / <em>innit</em>?</li>
<li>You're Jack's nephew, <em>aren't you</em> / <em>innit</em>?</li>
<li>They've been to Greece, <em>haven't they</em> / <em>innit?</em></li>
</ol>
<p>This simplifies tag questions, but why is that a bad thing? Many languages create tag questions using single morphemes, e.g. Bengali <em>kanna</em>.</p>
<p>(3) <strong>African-American Vernacular English</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>He be working Tuesdays (he is usually working on a Tuesday)</li>
<li>He been got a job (he got a job a long time ago)</li>
</ol>
<p>It grammaticalises concepts which are not grammaticalised in Standard English. Therefore it is RICHER (with regard to certain grammatical subsystems).</p>
<p>So how do prescriptive grammars arise? They reflect the dominant dialect in the country, which in turn is a consequence of which regions hold the most political and economic power. As Weinreich said <strong>'A language is a dialect with an army and a navy'</strong></p>

<p>This is a phenomena whereby we override our mental grammar, and instead adopt a prescriptive grammar. Our natural tendency is to say <em>Me and Jack went to the shops</em>. This is our <strong>mental grammar</strong>. However, in certain formal contexts, we may say <em>Jack and I went to the shops</em>, which is often prescribed at school.</p>
<p>Hypercorrection is interesting because it shows that prescriptive grammar has a lot of power over us.</p>

<p>These errors are known as 'blends'. Two words are activated, and combined into one, e.g. <em>expect</em> + <em>suppose</em> -&gt; <em>expose</em> / <em>misunderstand</em> + <em>underestimate</em> -&gt; <em>misunderestimate</em>. Note that when this happens there is often a phonological 'pivot' (my terminology) in the middle of word, i.e. material shared across both words. For exampel, the <em>p</em> in <em>expect</em> / <em>suppose</em></p>
<p>Characteristics: (1) Multiple Semantic Activation: overlapping meanings (2) Phonological processes in selection: similar word-internal phonology.</p>
<p>Process by which blends are formed combines <strong>opportunistic</strong> activation / assembly with <strong>rigorous</strong> monitoring</p>
<p>What does it tell us about words? They are stored in <strong>semantic and networks</strong> (activation of multiple words with overlapping meanings). There is <strong>activation across domains</strong>: <strong>semantic</strong> activation of multiple competitors, and <strong>phonological</strong> processes involved in blending (the use of a 'pivot'). The system <strong>biases speed over accuracy</strong>, but recovers from error due to a <strong>monitoring system</strong>.</p>

<p>Same form, and <strong>different but related</strong> meanings. The meaning relationship is <em>mentally represented</em></p>
<p>Prepositions are notoriously polysemous, e.g. <em>over</em> = straight movement in contact with a plane, e.g. <em>he ran over the field</em>, or <em>over =</em> two dimensional movement across a bounded plane, e.g. <em>the balloon floated over the city</em> (or possibly there is no movement at all), or <em>over</em> = random movement covering a plane_, e.g. he poured ketchup over the chips_.</p>

<li>The cup was <em>full</em>, the room was <em>full</em>, she has a <em>full</em> schedule, she leads a <em>full</em> life.</li>
</ol>
<p>Are meaning relationships systematic or random? According to Charles Fillmore (e.g. Fillmore &amp; Atkins, 2000), there is a central sense, with all meanings radiating from this central sense, e.g. all meanings of <em>over</em> share the idea that the 'figure' (smaller object) is, at some stage, above the 'ground' (larger object). All meanings of <em>bed</em> involve a flat surface made of a relatively soft material. When teaching a polysemous word, it may be best to start with the central meaning (or 'sense') of the word, and later teach the more peripheral meanings (e.g. Tyler &amp; Evans, 2004)</p>

<p>A says a word, and B says the first word that comes into their heads</p>
<p>Coordinates are the most frequent category, e.g. if the prime is <em>cat</em>, the participant says <em>dog</em>.

<p>Word association tasks conducted with children with Developmental Language Impairments find tentative evidence for reduced semantic networks, e.g. large number of responses which are very odd, e.g. <em>Spoon</em> -&gt; Disney, or based on phonological similarity, e.g. <em>cow</em> -&gt; <em>how</em> (Sheng &amp; McGregor, 2010)</p>

<p>Morphemes can be <strong>free</strong> or <strong>bound</strong>. If a morpheme is <em>free</em> it can also be classified as a word (because it can 'stand alone'). In the following sentence, we have examples of both <em>free</em> and <em>bound</em> closed-class morphemes</p>
<ol>
<li>Jack <strong>is</strong> (really) try-<strong>ing</strong> to run fast-<strong>er</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Bound morphemes can be <strong>prefixes</strong> or <strong>suffixes</strong> (which are both kinds of <strong>affixes</strong>). Another type of bound morpheme is the <strong>infix</strong>, which comes in the middle of the word. English rarely uses infixes, and when they are used they sound "marked" (odd), e.g. fan-<em>bloody</em>-tastic). Other languages use infixes productively, e.g. Arabic</p>
<p>Morphemes are divided into two categories, <strong><em>inflectional</em></strong> and <strong><em>derivational</em></strong>. While <em>inflectional</em> morphemes make minor modifications to a word's meaning, <em>derivational</em> morphemes are used to <em>derive</em> a new word, either by substantially changing meaning or altering word class.</p>
<p>Words containing multiple morphemes are described as <strong>morphologically complex</strong>. </p>

</ol>
<p>Now complete the following statements about the two types of morpheme, citing the examples above (answers provided).</p>
<ol>
<li>While INFLECTIONAL morphemes are involved in syntactic processes, DERIVATIONAL morphemes are not.</li>
<li>INFLECTIONAL morphemes participate in phonological processes to a greater extent than DERIVATIONAL morphemes</li>
<li>While INFLECTIONAL morphemes are very productive (we can add them to many words), DERIVATIONAL morphemes are less productive.</li>
<li>While DERIVATIONAL morphemes can come at the beginning and ends of words (prefixes and suffixes), INFLECTIONAL morphemes can only come at the end (suffix)</li>
</ol>
<p>Other differences: (1) Derivational morphemes are longer (2) Derivational morphemes have more specific meanings, e.g. <em>out</em> in <em>outmaneouvre</em> means "to do something better than a competitor" (3) Derivational morphemes are more language-specific, e.g. <em>out-</em> prefix is not found in Spanish, and <em>-ito/-illo</em> diminutive suffixes are not used productively in English. </p>

<p>There are three ways to form morphologically complex words using morphological processes</p>
<ol>
<li>Inflection (adding inflectional morphemes), e.g. <em>laugh-ed</em></li>
<li>Derivation (adding derivational morphemes), e.g. <em>un-do</em></li>
<li>Compounding (taking two words and "squishing" them together), e.g. <em>fire man</em>, <em>book seller</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Generally the last two are described as <strong>word-building processes</strong> as they can be used to coin new words, e.g. <em>skypeable</em>, or <em>red jacket man/woman</em> (a mysterious handsome stranger you see on the Metro every morning)</p>
<p>When we build morphologically-complex words, we tend follow a particular order</p>
<ol>
<li>We start out with the root</li>
<li>We add deriviational affixes</li>
<li>We add an inflectional affix</li>
</ol>
<p>This gives the impression that we build up the words in a series of steps.</p>

<p>Many studies quantify children's language abilities using the Mean Length of Utterance in Morphemes.</p>
<p>Language-impaired individuals tend to have difficulties using derivational morphemes. It is worthwhile teaching these morphemes in clinic as they can be used to build words.</p>

<p>Evidence that we process sounds which are potentially morphemes as morphemes (<em>morpho-phonological parsing</em> - Post et al. 2008). For example reaction times indicate that we parse pseudo-inflections, e.g. <em>mil</em><em>d</em><em><em> (potentially past tense of the verb </em>to mile</em>) as actual inflections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Words with regular inflectional affixes tend to be phonotactically irregular (e.g. irregular <em>lost</em> rhymes with <em>frost</em>, but regular <em>turned</em> does not rhyme with any other monomorphemic word). This suggests they are not stored.</p>
</li>

<li>Some complex forms contain <em>non-word roots</em>, indicating that they haven't been built up compositionally, e.g.</li>

<li>The food supplies were de<u>plete</u>d</li>
<li>Some morphemes have multiple meanings, e.g. <em>-er</em> = AGENT, e.g. <em>gardener</em>, or INSTRUMENT, e.g. paint <em>stripper</em>. If words are built up compositionally, how do we know which meaning of <em>-er</em> to select?</li>
<li>Psycholinguistic evidence indicates that some morphologically-complex forms are stored as wholes, e.g. Loscewicz (1995) found that inflections in high-frequency inflected forms were significantly shorter than in low-frequency inflected forms -&gt; high-frequency forms were stored as a whole. Alegre and Gordon (1999) found a relationship between whole-word frequency and performance on a nonword discrimination task when whole-word frequency exceeded 1 per 7 million.</li>

<p>There is strong evidence for both computational and whole word accounts. Novel inflected forms, e.g. <em>meek</em><em>ed</em><strong>, must be generated by adding the morpheme. Words with non-word roots, e.g. <em>unre<u>mitt</u>ingly</em> clearly cannot be generated compositionally. So we have </strong>two possible** routes to creating morphologically-complex words.</p>
<ol>
<li>High frequency morphologically complex forms are stored in the lexicon</li>
<li>Lower frequency forms are generated by computational processes</li>
</ol>
<p>This reflects a trade-off between speed of processing, and expressivity. Whole-word storage of morphologically complex forms -&gt; rapid processing.  Separate storage of morphemes allows coining of novel morphologically complex forms, e.g. <em>meek</em><em>ed</em>**.</p>
<p>Pronunciation of <em>mouth</em> in <em>Plymouth</em> versus <em>Cockermouth</em> may reflect two systems (high frequency form, stored as a whole, involves <em>schwa</em> sounds (neutral vowel)</p>
<p>The binary view may be too simple. Aitchison (2002) suggests a variety of different levels of storage. For example, the semantic <strong>transparency</strong> of morphemes (how interpretable they are) exhibits gradient properties.</p>
<p><em>Fogglemouth</em> = This is an imaginary town lying at the mouth of the river 'Foggle'. Suffix <em>-mouth</em> is fully transparent. It is applied using a productive rule &gt;
<em>Grangemouth</em> = A real town, but for those outside the Cumbria, this is likely to be a low-frequency word. It may be stored as a whole. Suffix <em>-mouth</em> is less transparent than the <em>-mouth</em> in <em>Fogglemouth</em> &gt;
<em>Plymouth</em> = High frquency word stored as unanalysed whole. Suffix <em>mouth</em> is less transparent than in <em>Grangemouth</em>.</p>
<p><em>chickenless</em> (FULLY PRODUCTIVE / TRANSPARENT) &gt;
<em>careless</em> (PARTIALLY PRODUCTIVE / TRANSPARENT) &gt;
<em>gormless, ruthless</em> (NOT PRODUCTIVE / TRANSPARENT)</p>
<p>For <em>chickenless</em>, both morphemes are semantically transparen. The word looks derived. For <em>careless</em>, the morphemes are transparent, but we are likely to store and process the word as a whole. Finally, in <em>gormless</em> and <em>ruthless</em> the roots are not semantically transparent.</p>

<p>Ullman and Pinker  explain language difficulties in terms of the computational and lexical systems, and also give it a neuropsychological grounding. The computational system is governed by <strong>procedural memory</strong> (involved in the acquisition of unconscious, implicit routines), while the lexical system resides in <strong>declarative memory</strong>. In particular, they focus on verbs</p>
<ol>
<li>Irregular forms are stored as wholes in the lexicon</li>
<li>Regular forms are generated via the computational system</li>
</ol>
<p>(NB Pinker and Ullman accept that high-frequency inflected forms <em>may</em> be stored in the lexicon)</p>
<p>The two systems <strong>compete</strong> with each other under time pressure. If an irregular form is found, the computational process is blocked. If the irregular form is not found, the computational process takes over.</p>
<p>Evidence:</p>
<ol>
<li>Frequency effects are only found in the irregular system only</li>
<li>Children's overregularisation errors, e.g. <em>she swammed</em> are determined by the density of the irregular neighbourhood which the irregular root belongs to.</li>
<li>Adult generation of inflected form is affected by input frequency only in the irregular system.</li>
<li>Difficulties with regular forms are linked to impaired procedural memory</li>
<li>Children with Developmental Language Disorder</li>
<li>Adults with Parkinsons</li>
<li>Adults with Broca's-type aphasia</li>

<p>Irregulars exhibit characteristics of the regular system, e.g. verbs already ending in an alveolar plosive are more likely to be irregular, e.g. <em>meet -&gt; met, let -&gt; let, put -&gt; put, shut -&gt; meet -&gt; met</em>, and nouns already ending in -s are more likely to take irregular plurals, e.g. <em>goose -&gt; geese, mouse -&gt; mice, moose -&gt; moose</em>. This has led some researchers to argue that there are not two completely separate systems for regular and irregular forms, e.g. Joanisse and Seidenberg (1999)</p>

<p>The Dual Route model argues that frequency effects are characteristic of the lexical/declarative system, but not the computational system. Nonetheless, frequency effects also characterise the regular system (e.g. Losiewicz and Alegre &amp; Gordon studies cited above)</p>

<li>"will" future: I'll help you to carry that shopping.</li>
<li>"going to" future: I think I'm going to be sick.</li>
<li>"about to" future: I am about to be sick</li>
<li>PRESENT TENSE as future: The train leaves at 6.15</li>
<li>PRESENT PROGRESSIVE as future: We're leaving at 10am.</li>
</ol>
<p>These forms for expressing the future <u>are generally not described as tenses</u> because</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>They are not morphological forms (i.e. they involve more than verb endings)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They express meanings <u>above and beyond</u> the future.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For example....</p>
<ol>
<li>"will" is used for OFFERS and PREDICTIONS</li>
<li>I'll help you with that bag</li>
<li>I think it will rain tomorrow</li>
<li>"going to" is used to talk about the FUTURE BASED ON CURRENT EVIDENCE, or PLANS</li>
<li>I think I'm going to be sick (because I feel nauseous)</li>
<li>I'm going to apply for a Speech and Language Therapy course</li>
<li>PRESENT TENSE is used for a TIMETABLED FUTURE</li>
<li>The train leaves at 6.15</li>
<li>PRESENT PROGRESSIVE is used for a FUTURE ARRANGEMENT</li>
<li>I'm studying Speech and Language Therapy next year (I already have a place on a course)</li>
<li>"be about to" is for the NEAR FUTURE</li>
<li>The players are warming up. The match is about to begin.</li>
</ol>
<p>Because future forms in English are not strictly tenses, we are going to refer to the "future tense" in inverted commas.</p>
<p>Next week, we're going to be looking at the syntax/morphology of tense in more detail.</p>

<p>Zoetrope - a victorian parlour toy designed to create a moving image (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hE_fA9M580&amp;t=1m18s)</p>
<p>Which of the following verbs would make a good zoetrope?</p>
<ol>
<li>swim</li>
<li>crash</li>
<li>laugh</li>
<li>dive</li>
<li>pop</li>
<li>dance</li>
<li>exist</li>
</ol>
<p>For a verb to work in zoetrope it needs (a) 'internal structure' (b) no definite end point, e.g. running, walking, swimming.</p>
<p>We can see that certain verbs have particular temporal properties. These properties are referred to as "lexical aspect" (sometimes called "aktionsarten")</p>
<h4 id="lecture%20notes-06%20-%20the%20semantics%20of%20events-a-states-versus-non-states">### (a) States versus non-states<a class="headerlink" href="#lecture%20notes-06%20-%20the%20semantics%20of%20events-a-states-versus-non-states" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>States are abstract, and do not have "internal structure" (e.g. "existing" doesnt' vary in any way across time, while when you are running, different snapshots will show your arms and legs in completely different positions). Non-states have internal structure.</p>
<p>Examples of states are "existing verbs",  <em>be, live, exist,</em> "experiencer-theme verbs", e.g. <em>like, love, hate</em>, and mental state verbs, e.g. <em>believe, know, hope</em>.</p>
<p>Tests...</p>
<ol>
<li>Because they are abstract they are difficult to define. E.g. you can give a good definition of <em>run</em>, but try to give a definition of <em>exist</em>, or <em>like</em></li>
<li>State verbs sound odd in the progressive (-ing form), e.g. ??<em>she is existing, ??she is liking the food, ??I am believing in fairies</em>. This is becuase the progressive places us inside the event, and this is difficult to do when an event does not have a rich internal structure.</li>
<li>They sound odd as reponses to the question <em>what happened?</em>, e.g. <em>Q. What happened? ???A. She liked the food</em></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="lecture%20notes-06%20-%20the%20semantics%20of%20events-b-activities-versus-events">(b) Activities versus events<a class="headerlink" href="#lecture%20notes-06%20-%20the%20semantics%20of%20events-b-activities-versus-events" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Activities do not have a natural end point (they are "atelic"). Events have a natural end point (they are "telic").</p>
<p>Examples of activities are <em>run, walk, wash, work</em>. Examples of events are <em>break, collapse, crash, fall</em></p>
<p>Because activities do not have a natural endpoint, they sound good when used with time expressions which imply an incomplete activity e.g. <em>I've been walking <u>for an hour</u> (and I may continue to walk for another hour).</em> By contrast events sound odd when used with such time expressions, e.g ${<em>}$ </em>It collapsed <u>for an hour.</u>*</p>
<p>Events sound good with time expressions which imply a complete activity, e.g. <em>The bridge collapsed <u>in five seconds</u></em>. Activities do not sound good with such time expressions, e.g. ${<em>}$ </em>He walked in five minutes*</p>

<p>Achievements are instantaneous events, taking place in a very brief instant, while accomplishments can take place over an extended period of time. The linguistic term to descibe this phenomenon is "durative" (see table below). A durative event is one which is extended in time.</p>
<p>Because Achievements are instantaneous / non-durative, they cannot be stopped in the middle, e.g.</p>
<ol>
<li>? They stopped reaching the summit</li>
<li>? The balloon stopped popping</li>
</ol>
<p>This contrasts with Accomplishments which <em>can</em> be stopped in the middle, eg.</p>
<ol>
<li>She stopped jumping over the stairs</li>
<li>They stopped building the house</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition, because Accomplishments are extended in time, we can use them with progressive grammatical aspect, while we cannot do this with Acheivements, e.g.</p>
<ol>
<li>They are building the house</li>
<li>? They are reaching the summit</li>
</ol>

<p>Some verbs seem to have more than one lexical aspect</p>
<ol>
<li>I <strong>like</strong> cheese (STATE)</li>
<li>She <strong>liked</strong> my post on facebook (i.e. pressed "like") (ACHIEVEMENT)</li>
<li>I <strong>have</strong> a car (STATE)</li>
<li>She's <strong>having</strong> a good time (ACTIVITY)</li>
<li>I <strong>love</strong> that dress (STATE)</li>
<li>I'm <strong>loving</strong> this book (ACTIVITY???)</li>
<li>Be quiet. I'm <strong>thinking</strong> (ACTIVITY)</li>
<li>I <strong>think</strong> you're really rude (STATE)</li>
</ol>
<p>So what's going on here? One possibility is that each verb has two different meanings corresponding to different lexical aspects. This is certainly the case for <em>think</em> (<em>thinking</em> as an activity versus <em>think</em>=believe). With other verbs it's possibly to identify a primary meaning, and a secondary meaning which is an extension of the primary meaning, e.g. <em>love = STATE</em> -&gt; <em>loving = ACTIVITY.</em></p>
<p>Some verbs can `shift' lexical aspect depending on sentence context;</p>
<ol>
<li>She's is dancing (ACTIVITY)</li>
<li>She finally danced the tango (ACHIEVEMENT)</li>
<li>The light is flashing (ACTIVITY, NB there is an `iterative' interpretation)</li>
<li>The light flashed (ACHIEVEMENT)</li>
</ol>
<p>However, it is often possible to identify a `core', most frequently used lexical aspect.</p>

<p>Grammatical aspect refers to <u>grammatical devices to signal one's perpsective on an event</u>. In English there are two grammatical aspects: PROGRESSIVE and PERFECTIVE. The progressive (-ing form), signals an INTERNAL perspective on the event, while the perfective (-en form) signals an EXTERNAL perspective on the event, </p>
<ol>
<li>He is danc<strong>ing</strong> (PROGRESSIVE aspect)</li>
<li>She is sing<strong>ing</strong> (PROGRESSIVE aspect)</li>
</ol>
<p>We are "inside" the event in the sense that the event continues up till the time of speaking, and will continue after the time of speaking.</p>
<ol>
<li>King Kong has fall<strong>en</strong> (PERFECTIVE aspect)</li>
<li>I have brok<strong>en</strong> the chair (PERFECTIVE aspect)</li>
</ol>
<p>We are "outside" the event in the sense that the event is complete.</p>
<p>Other languages have richer systems, e.g Spanish differentiates between the Imperfective and the Progressive.</p>

<p>Students often confuse tense and aspect. Don't worry, this is normal, as these concepts are very closely related. Here are two sentences which demostrate the difference:</p>
<ol>
<li>By this time next week, I <u>will have eaten</u> all of the tins of baked beans in my cupboard</li>
</ol>
<p>This sentence uses the "WILL" FUTURE, but perfective aspect to express COMPLETION</p>
<ol>
<li>She <u>was sleeping</u> when the earthquake happened</li>
</ol>
<p>This sentence is in the PAST TENSE but uses progressive aspect to describe an ONGOING event.</p>

<p>Tense, grammatical and lexical aspect combine in weird and wonderful ways. This is a very complex system and we can only begin to scrape the surface.</p>

<p>Children with SLI have difficulties marking tense, e.g.</p>
<ol>
<li>He went there -&gt; Him go there</li>
</ol>
<p>However, this is a difficulty with the morphological expression of tense, rather than a difficulty understanding what tense means.</p>
<p>Young children, when acquiring tense, <strong>conflate tense and aspect</strong>. They are more likely to mark paste tense on Achievement and Accomplishment verbs, because these tend to describe COMPLETED events. Some studies have argued that by manipulating the lexical aspect of verbs you can help children acquire tense (Van Horne, A. J. O., Fey, M., &amp; Curran, M. (2017). Do the Hard Things First: A Randomized Controlled Trial Testing the Effects of Exemplar Selection on Generalization Following Therapy for Grammatical Morphology. <em>Journal of Speech Language and Hearing Research</em>, <em>60</em>(9), 2569; Johnson, B. W., &amp; Morris, S. R. (2007). Clinical implications of the effects of lexical aspect and phonology on children’s production of the regular past tense. <em>Child Language Teaching and Therapy</em>, <em>23</em>(3), 287–306.) In fact, Van Horne et al. found that children with DLD were better at producing the past tense forms when trained on more difficult items!</p>
<p>Some studies have found that language-impaired children have difficulties comprehending and producing grammatical aspect (Fletcher, P., Leonard, L. B., Stokes, S. F., &amp; Wong, A. M. Y. (2005). The expression of aspect in Cantonese-speaking children with Specific Language Impairment. <em>Journal of Speech Language and Hearing Research</em>, <em>48</em>(3); Leonard, L.

<p>Finite = verb has tense (present or past)</p>
<p>Non-finite = verb does not have tense</p>
<p>There are three non-finite forms; the perfective form, e.g. <em>I have <u>broken</u> it</em>, the progressive form, e.g. <em>I am <u>eating</u> it</em>, and the infinitive, e.g. <em>I hope <u>to get</u> married some day</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>NB WORD OF WARNING: The <em>perfective from</em> is often called the <em>past participle</em>. The <em>past participle</em> is terrible name, as we can use it to talk about the future, e.g. By this time tomorrow <em>I <u>will have finished</u> the essay</em>. It really refers to a COMPLETED event (we take an EXTERNAL perspective). Likewise the <em>progressive form</em> is sometimes called the <em>present participle</em>. This is also a terrible name as the <em>present participle</em> does not have to refer to now, e.g. <em>She <u>was laughing</u></em>. It really refers to an INCOMPLETE / ONGOING EVENT (we take an INTERNAL perspective)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finite forms tend to have a richer <strong>inflectional morphology</strong>, i.e. the form of the verb changes depending on the subject. In English the inflectional morphology is relatively <em>sparse</em>, e.g.</p>

<p>Grammatical Aspect is used to signal one's PERSPECTIVE on an event. We can take an EXTERNAL perspective on the event (Perfective aspect), or INTERNAL perspective (Progressive aspect)</p>
<p>Perfective aspect requires "have" as the agreeing auxiliary</p>

<p>When combining tense and aspect we</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Mark aspect on the rightmost verb and insert an appropriate auxiliary verb </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repeat last rule if necessary</p>
</li>
<li>Mark tense (plus ”the future”) on the leftmost verb</li>
</ol>
<p>Aspect expresses the PERSPECTIVE. Tense expresses the VIEWPOINT (past / present / future), e.g.</p>
<ol>
<li>She has$<em>{PRES.~TENSE}$ eaten$</em>{PERF.~ASP}$ the food</li>
</ol>
<p>Perfective Aspect signals an EXTERNAL PERSPECTIVE on the event (the event is completed). Past tense shows that we adopt a PRESENT VIEWPOINT on the event. This is the "Present Perfect" and it is used when when a completed event has relevance for the present, e.g. <em>I have eaten the food, and therefore I am full</em></p>
<ol>
<li>We 'll be$<em>{FUT.~TENSE}$ eating$</em>{PROG.~ASPECT}$ dinner when you arrive</li>
</ol>
<p>Progressive Aspect signals an INTERNAL PERSPECTIVE on the event (it is ongoing). Future tense shows that we adopt a FUTURE VIEWPOINT. This is the "Future Progressive" and it is used to describe an ongoing future event.</p>

<p>Almost all sentences of English needs a <strong>Subject</strong> and a <strong>Verb</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>[ Syntax $<em>{SUBJECT}$ ] <strong>rocks!</strong> $</em>{VERB}$</li>
<li>[ Madonna $<em>{SUBJECT}$ ] <strong>sings</strong>  $</em>{VERB}$</li>
<li>[ That donkey $<em>{SUBJECT}$ ] <strong>kicks!</strong>  $</em>{VERB}$</li>
</ol>
<p>The Subject is often the do-er, e.g. <em>Madonna</em> is the person who sings, and <em>the donkey</em> is the thing that kicks. However, in the following sentence</p>
<ol>
<li>Breakfast is served</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Breakfast</em> is not the do-er. This shows that functions express a relationship which is only <strong>loosely linked to meaning</strong>. Functions express <strong>syntactic relationships</strong>, and are more closely related to <strong>sentence position</strong> than meaning. For example, in English, the Noun Phrase which comes immediately before the verb is always the Subject.</p>
<p>In many languages the formal relationship between subject and verb is expressed via <strong>agreement</strong>. This means that the form of the verb is linked to the type of subject, e.g.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Person</th>
<th>Singular</th>
<th>Plural</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1st (speaker)</td>
<td>I sing</td>
<td>We sing</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2nd (addressee)</td>
<td>You sing</td>
<td>You sing</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3rd (person outside the conversation)</td>
<td>She <strong>sing-s</strong></td>
<td>They sing</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>We can see that the English paradigm is very sparse. However, other languages have much richer verb agreement paradigms, e.g. Spanish and Latin.</p>

<p>After the verb, we often (but not always) have an Object</p>
<ol>
<li>Syntax rocks [ <strong>my world!</strong> $_{OBJECT}$ ]</li>
<li>Madonna sings [ <strong>catchy tunes</strong> $_{OBJECT}$ ]</li>
<li>That donkey kicks [ <strong>people</strong> $_{OBJECT}$ ]</li>
</ol>
<p>These are "chosen" by the verb in the sense that only certain verbs can take objects. For example, after the verbs <em>yawn</em> and <em>run</em> we typically do not have objects, e.g.</p>
<ol>
<li>He yawned</li>
<li>She ran</li>
</ol>
<p>These are called <strong>intransitive</strong> verbs.</p>
<p>Some verbs take two objects, in which case we have a <strong>direct</strong> and an <strong>indirect object</strong>.</p>
<table>

<p>Note that the Indirect Object is "parasitic" on the Direct Object in the sense that it needs a Direct Object in order to be realised;</p>
<ol>
<li>Janet gave [ a book $_{Direct~Object}$]</li>
<li>Janet gave [ a book $<em>{Direct~Object}$]. [ to Mary $</em>{Indirect~Object}$ ]</li>
<li>?? Janet gave [ to Mary $_{Indirect~Object}$ ]</li>
</ol>
<p>For the following sentences, which are the direct and indirect objects?</p>
<ol>
<li>Albert showed Victoria his stamp collection</li>
<li>Ennis brought a book for Angie</li>
<li>Could you rustle me up an omellete?</li>
<li>Patricia sent her friend a letter</li>
</ol>
<p>NB sometimes there is more than one option to realise direct versus indirect objects:</p>
<ol>
<li>Abdul sent Josh a letter <em>(called the "Double Object Dative")</em></li>
<li>Abdul sent a letter <strong>to</strong> Josh <em>(called the "Prepositional Dative")</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Od and Oi are "chosen" by the verb, in the sense that there are particular verbs which tend to take two objects. Groups of verbs taking two objects are verbs of physical transfer (<em>give, take, receive, lend, borrow, deliver, donate, show</em>) and verbs of metaphorical transfer (<em>tell, explain</em>)</p>
<h2 id="lecture%20notes-08%20-%20syntactic%20functions-b-subject-and-object-complements">(b) Subject and Object complements<a class="headerlink" href="#lecture%20notes-08%20-%20syntactic%20functions-b-subject-and-object-complements" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Subject Complements (Cs) are phrases which <strong>describe a property of the subject</strong>, while Object Complements (Co) <strong>describe a property of the object</strong>. Here are some examples:</p>
<ol>
<li>Jack is [ terrible at maths ] = Cs describing Subject <em>Jack</em></li>
<li>Ali appears [ troubled ] at the moment = Cs describing Subject <em>Ali</em></li>
<li>I consider him [ my best friend ] = Co describing Object <em>him</em></li>
<li>I want that bedroom [ cleaned ] by tomorrow = Co describing Object <em>bedroom</em></li>
<li>Genevieve painted her bedroom walls [ dark green ] = Co describing Object <em>her bedroom walls</em></li>
<li>The mechanic hammered the panel [ flat ] = Co describing Object <em>the panel</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Note that while Subjects and Objects are realised as Noun Phrases, Subject and Object Complements can be realised in many ways, e.g. as Adjective Phrases (e.g. <em>terrible at maths</em>), or as Prepositional Phrases, e.g. <em>he ripped the paper [ into pieces ]</em>.</p>
<p>Here is a list of verbs which tend to take complements</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Verbs which can take subject complements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The copula - <em>is/are/was/were</em></p>
</li>
<li>Verbs of appearance - <em>seem, appear, look, e.g. she seems / looks / appears tired</em></li>
<li>Verbs of perception - *feel, smell, sound, taste, e.g. the food smells / tastes funny</li>
<li>
<p>Verbs of persistence - stay, remain, e.g. You must stay / remain calm </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Verbs which can take object complements : <em>appoint, call, certify, consider, crown, declare, elect, find, hold, imagine, keep, like, make, name, prefer, proclaim, profess, pronounce, prove, report, send, think, turn</em> </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Complements are less moveable than objects. For example, in (1) and (2) below, we can move the objects to the front of the sentence. But this is not the case for complements (3) and (4)</p>
<ol>
<li>Jack gave Peter the book -&gt; The book was given to Peter by Jack</li>
<li>Jack gave Peter the book -&gt; Peter was given the book by Jack</li>
<li>Jack resembles Paul -&gt; * Paul is resembled by Jack</li>
<li>Magda named her daughter Isobel -&gt; * Isobel was named her daughter by Magda</li>
</ol>
<p>NB these types of sentences are all examples of "the passive" which will be covered next semester</p>

<p>In many cases, the verb determines the functions which we can use, e.g. <em>sit</em> cannot be used with an Object Noun Phrase.</p>
<ol>
<li>Jack sat</li>
<li>$*$ Jack sat [ the chair $_{OBJECT<sub>NOUN</sub>PHRASE}$]</li>
</ol>
<p>All of the above functions are, more-or-less, "chosen" by the verb.</p>
<p>However, there are two functions which are not "chosen" by the verb: Adverbial and Postmodifier.</p>
<p>An adverbial is a phrase (consisting of either a single word, or a group of words) which (a) modifies the verb or the sentence, and (b) occupies a "peripheral" position in the sentence, i.e. at the very beginning or the very end, and (c) can occur in EITHER peripheral position (i.e. it can be placed either at the beginning or end)</p>
<ol>
<li>[ On Tuesday ] we should have a picnic [ in my opinion ]</li>
<li>[ With a bit of luck ] we will have good weather [ from tomorrow ]</li>
</ol>
<p>Though <em>luckily</em> in the following sentence has precisely the same function as the Adverbial <em>with a bit of luck</em> it is not peripheral, and therefore we are not categorising it as an adverbial. It is a adverb coming inside the Verb Complex.</p>
<ol>
<li>We [ <em>luckily</em> had $_{VERB~COMPLEX}$] good weather</li>
</ol>
<p>While Adverbials modify the verb, or sentence, Postmodifiers modify the Noun. They come <strong>after</strong> the noun, e.g.</p>
<ol>
<li>The <strong>man</strong> [ with the red hat ] followed me down the street</li>
<li>The <strong>dog</strong> [ that scratched me ] was a Border Collie</li>
</ol>

<p>The syntactic function of a word or phrase may impact on its morphology. This phenomenon is called <strong>case-marking</strong>. A word whose morphology demonstrates its syntactic function is said to be <strong>case-marked</strong>.</p>
<p>In English, case-marking only applies to Pronouns:</p>
<ol>
<li>Subject form (called NOMINATIVE or SUBJECTIVE case) = I, you, he/she/it, we, you, they</li>
<li>Od, Oi, Cs, Co form (called ACCUSATIVE or OBJECTIVE form) = Me, you, him/her/it, us, you. them</li>
</ol>
<p>We also apply the GENITIVE CASE (denoting possession) to Nouns, e.g.</p>
<ol>
<li>She scratched <strong>Anna's</strong> car.</li>
</ol>
<p>Other language have much richer case systems, e.g. with special forms for direct versus indirect objects, and the possibility of marking case on Nouns as well as pronouns.</p>

<p>They also have case-marking difficulties in subject position, often using the accusative case, instead, e.g.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Him</strong> go there.</li>
</ol>
<p>They also fail to inflect the verb which results in a loss of Subject-Verb agreement (as shown above, correct form of the verb is <em>goes</em>)</p>

<p>It may be easier to see that it is a Direct Object if you substitute it for the word "something" (the SOMETHING TEST!!)</p>

<li>I'll name [ this ship <sub>Od</sub> ] [ whatever I want <sub>Co</sub> ] (King Charles -  (hungover))</li>

<p>Here is an example of a dependent clause in subject position</p>
<ol>
<li>[ That she passed the exam <sub>S</sub> ]  surprised her teacher.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, it sounds a bit weird. It would be much more natural to say to move the long Subject to the end and replace it with a dummy/expletive "it":</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>It</strong> surprised her teacher [ that she passed the exam ]</li>
</ol>
<p>Why does this happen? In English we do not like very long phrases ar the beginning of a sentence. Here is another example</p>
<ol>
<li>I feel _ about weddings [ the way cats feel about waterslides ] (Nell Frizelle, Guardian)</li>
</ol>
<p>The phrase "the way cats feel about waterslides" has moved from its initial position (shown by the underscore):</p>
<ol>
<li>I feel [ the way cats feel about waterslides ] about weddings.</li>
</ol>
<p>But this just doesn't work!!</p>
<p>Some researchers have suggested that there is a cross-linguistic tendency to shift long phrases to the end of a sentence to "save the difficult things till last". However, some languages seem to like long phrases at the front (Japanese).</p>

<p>A postmodifier is a phrase which comes after a noun and modifies it.</p>
<ol>
<li>I found the book [ under the sofa ]</li>
<li>I saw a man [ with the wooden leg ]</li>
</ol>
<p>Clauses can also come in postmodifier position</p>
<ol>
<li>She never gave me a reason [ why she arrived late ]</li>
<li>I didn't believe Giles' claim [ that Geoff ate the chocolate cake ]</li>
<li>I found the book [ that was under the sofa ]</li>

<p>This is the type of clause that appears in the chorus of Girls and Boys:</p>
<p>(We're) Looking for Girls <u>who are boys</u>

<u>Who do boys like they're girls</u>
<u>Who do girls like they're boys</u>.

<p>These are "restrictive" relative clauses. They take a set of entities, and <strong>restrict</strong> them to those entities with a specific property. e.g. "girls who are boys" is a subset of "girls". We can also use <strong>non-restrictive</strong> relative clauses, which just provide extra information.</p>

<p><strong>(a) Summary of properties</strong></p>
<p>Relative clauses have a number of interesting properties.</p>
<ol>
<li>They are headed by a <strong>relative pronoun</strong> (who, that, which).</li>
<li>The can contain <strong>unusual word orders</strong> (e.g. <em>There's the cat$<em>{OBJ}$ I$</em>{SUB}$ saw$_{VERB}$</em>)</li>
<li>They can <strong>split Subjects from Verbs</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>(b) The relative pronoun</strong></p>
<p>The word which introduces the relative clause (<em>that, which, who</em>) is best described as a Pronoun. Why?</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>She</strong> likes <strong>her</strong>: Pronouns are marked for CASE.</li>
<li><strong>She</strong> likes <strong>it</strong>: Pronouns are marked for ANIMACY DISTINCTION</li>
</ol>
<p>Now let's look at case-marking in relative pronouns:</p>
<ol>
<li>There's the man <strong>who</strong> saw him</li>
<li>There's the man <strong>whom</strong> he saw</li>
</ol>
<p>And the animacy distinction</p>
<ol>
<li>There's the man <strong>who</strong> I saw.</li>
<li>I found the money <strong>that</strong> I dropped.</li>
</ol>
<p>Occasionally the relative pronoun can be omitted:</p>
<ol>
<li>I found the money (that) I dropped</li>
</ol>
<p>The rules for this are slightly complicated.</p>
<p>We can imagine the relative pronoun as "moving" to the front of the relative clause:</p>
<ol>
<li>He saw <strong>him</strong> -&gt; There's the man <strong>whom</strong> he saw.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>(c) Unusual word orders</strong></p>
<p>When the relative pronoun refers to the OBJECT, we have an unusual (OSV) word order:</p>
<ol>
<li>There's the man who <sub>Obj.</sub> I <sub>Subj.</sub>  saw <sub>V</sub></li>
<li>There's the fish that that <sub>Obj.</sub> she <sub>Subj.</sub>  ate <sub>V</sub></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>(d) Splitting subjects from verbs</strong></p>
<p>If relative clauses come in the middle of sentences they can split Subjects from Verbs</p>
<ol>
<li>The <strong>man</strong> [ who I saw ] <strong>was</strong> happy</li>

<p>Relative clauses are very widely used in linguistic research because:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>They vary in interesting ways across languages</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In some languages they allow you create simple and complex versions of the same sentence WITHOUT MAKING ANY CHANGES TO THE WORDS IN THE SENTENCE</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>e.g. <em>There's the cat that chased the dog / There's the dog that the cat chased</em></p>
<p>This is incredibly useful because we can control for lexical factors and sentence length, while focusing on syntactic complexity.</p>
<ol>
<li>They are very sensitive to overall linguistic ability. Language impaired individuals find relative clauses particularly difficult to process.</li>

<p>After the verb <em>remember</em> we can complete the sentence in 5 different ways. <em>Remember</em> takes five different kinds of <em>complements</em>. The <em>complement</em> <strong>completes</strong> the sentence, e.g.</p>
<ol>
<li>A: Dr Who remembered.</li>
<li>B: Remembered what?</li>
<li>A: Dr Who remembered [ the sonic screwdriver $_{NP}$ ]</li>
</ol>
<p>and...</p>
<ol>
<li>X: Jeanine filled the car</li>
<li>Y: With what?</li>
<li>X: Jeanine filled the car [ with Petrol $_{PP}$ ]</li>
</ol>
<p>and...</p>
<ol>
<li>P: Jack is proud.</li>
<li>Q: Of What?</li>
<li>P: Jack is proud [ of his essay $_{PP}$ ]</li>
</ol>
<p>NB we have previously used the word <em>complement</em> to describe 2 different syntactic functions: the Subject and Object complements. Here we are using complement in a broader fashion to describe 'ways of completing the sentence'. Under this broader definition, direct and indirect objects can also be described as complements</p>

<p>Complements are "chosen" by verbs, or other words/phrases in the sentence. They sentence sounds odd without them.</p>
<p>Modifying phrases feel "added on". They are optional. There are two types of modifying phrases, Adverials, and Postmodifiers (see below).</p>
<h1 id="lecture%20notes-xx%20-%20complementation%20versus%20modification-complements-of-the-verb">Complements of the verb<a class="headerlink" href="#lecture%20notes-xx%20-%20complementation%20versus%20modification-complements-of-the-verb" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>All post-verbal arguments can be described as complements of the verb. These are Od, Oi, Co, Cs. So far, we have only looked at phrasal complements, e.g. Noun Phrases, Adjective Phrases, or Prepositional Phrases.</p>
<ol>
<li>Amy <strong>dropped</strong> [ the pen $_{NP}$ ]</li>
<li>Jack <strong>painted</strong> $[$ the roof  $<em>{NP}$ $]$ $[$ bright red $</em>{Adj.}$ $]$</li>
<li>Jack <strong>smashed</strong> $[$ the vase $<em>{NP}$ $]$ $[$ into pieces $</em>{Prep.~Phrase}$ $]$</li>
</ol>
<p>Verbs can also specify <strong>clausal complements</strong> (i.e. mini sentences)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Jack <strong>said</strong> [ that he was hungry $_{Clause}$  ]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Magda <strong>alleged</strong> $[$ that Carter was seeing another woman $_{Clause<sub>(with</sub>"that")}$ $]$</p>
</li>
<li>Angie <strong>told</strong> $[$ Mel $<em>{NP}$ $]$  $[$ that she was seeing another woman $</em>{Clause<sub>(with</sub>"that")}$ $]$</li>
</ol>
<p>When a clause is used a complement it takes on the same function as the equivalent Noun Phrase, e.g. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Angie <strong>told</strong> $[$ Mel $<em>{NP<sub>=</sub> Oi}$ $]$  $[$ something $</em>{Od}$ $]$</p>
</li>
<li>

<p><strong>Phrases</strong> = Groups of words <strong>which behave as a whole</strong>. We can do tests for phrases, e.g. can you question them or substitute them?</p>
<p><strong>Functions</strong> = A label to describe the <strong>syntactic role</strong> which phrases play in a sentence. NB though certain functions tend to have certain <strong>semantic roles</strong>, functions are primarily <strong>syntactic</strong>, e.g.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The sweets</strong> were given to all those with perfect marks</li>
</ol>
<p><em>The sweets</em> is the Direct Object of the "underlying" sentence, e.g. <em>she gave </em><em>the sweets</em><em> to the child</em>. However, here <em>the sweets</em> has been moved into Subject position, and <u>is therefore a subject</u>. Note that it has the <strong>formal syntactic properties</strong> of a Subject, namely subject-verb agreement (<em>the sweets <del>are</del> / were</em>), and nominative case-marking when the Noun Phrase is replaced by a pronoun (<em>they / <del>them</del> were given to all those with perfect marks</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Argument</strong> = Essential Participants in the event described by the verb. The arguments are chosen by the verbs. The verb also specifies the role fo the arguments, and their order.</p>
<p><strong>Complement (narrow definition)</strong> = Word to describe a post-verbal argument which serves to modify either the Subject or Object.</p>
<p><strong>Complement (broader definition)</strong> = A phrase which "completes" the sentence. It is chosen by a particular word, and comes after that word. Postverbal arguments (e.g. Od, Oi, Co, Ci) can be described as complements of the verb. However, other word classes can have complements, e.g. Adjectives and Nouns.</p>

<p>As mentioned, there are two modifying functions: Adverbials and Postmodifiers. While Adverbials tend to modify the entire sentence, Postmodifiers modify the preceding Noun Phrase.</p>
<ol>
<li>$[$ Next Tuesday $<em>{Adverbial}$ $]$ we'll sell our house $[$ with any luck $</em>{Adverbial}$  $]$</li>
<li>The house $[$ at the end of the street $_{PP<sub>acting</sub>as~Post-Modifer}$ $]$ was for sale</li>
<li>The house $[$ that was at the end of the street $_{Clause<sub>acting</sub>as~Post-Modifer}$ $]$ was for sale</li>
</ol>
<p>Both types of modifying phrases are optional. Adverbials are also moveable, and are able to occur at either peripheral position (the very beginning or very end of the sentence).</p>
<h2 id="lecture%20notes-xx%20-%20complementation%20versus%20modification-focus-on-adverbials">Focus on adverbials<a class="headerlink" href="#lecture%20notes-xx%20-%20complementation%20versus%20modification-focus-on-adverbials" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Adverbials and adverbs refer to <em>almost</em> the same thing</p>
<ol>
<li>Adverb = a single word which tends to sit in the verb complex and modfies the verb, e.g. <em>She $[$ </em><em>quickly</em><em> ran $_{Verb~Complex}$ $]$ to the shops</em></li>
<li>Adverbial = a phrase (often containing multiple words) which sits at the sentence periphery, and modifies the entire sentence, e.g. <em>$[$ Next Tuesday $<em>{Adverbial}$ $]$ we'll sell our house $[$ with any luck $</em>{Adverbial}$ $]$</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Adverbials have a variety of functions. They can be used to express manner, place, or time, e.g.</p>
<ol>
<li>MANNER: She walks [ with a slight limp ]</li>
<li>PLACE: She plays cricket [ in the park ]</li>
<li>TIME: [ On Tuesday ] she sold the house</li>
</ol>
<p>The can also express a variety of discourse functions, e.g.</p>
<ol>
<li>CHANGING TOPIC: [ Anway ], have you heard the news about Ruth?</li>
<li>EXPRESSING LOGICAL RELATIONSHIPS: [ However ], she still couldn't lift heavy weights. (NB the sentence CONTRADICTS information in the preceding discourse, e.g. <em>She trained hard. </em><em>However</em><em> she still couldn't lift heavy weights</em>).</li>
<li>EXPRESSING AN OPINION: [ In my opinion ] we should treat syntactic difficulties using recasts</li>

<p>How do we know which type of complement to use after a verb, adjective or noun? To a certain extent complement types are predictable from the meaning of the verb, noun, or adjective. For example, we tend to use clausal complements with mental state verbs because clauses describe imaginary scenes or situations which we are able to think about.</p>
<ol>
<li>I hope [ that you won't miss the train ]</li>
<li>I imagine [ that he was very angry ]</li>
<li>I believe [ that he's in a relationship ]</li>
</ol>
<p>However, complements are not wholly predictable from meaning. Why are we <em>surprised</em> <strong>by</strong> something, but <em>delighted</em> <strong>with</strong> something? <em>Admire</em> and <em>like</em> have very similar meanings (a positive emotion about someone) but they differ very much in their syntactic behaviour:</p>
<ol>
<li>I <strong>like</strong> $[​$ that you don't get down about stuff $_{that<sub>plus</sub>clause}​$ $]​$</li>
<li>?? I <strong>admire</strong> $[$ that you don't get down about stuff $_{that<sub>plus</sub>clause}$  $]$</li>
</ol>
<p>The answer is that the word specifies its own syntactic behaviour.</p>

<p>We were introduced to the "lemma" at the end of Week 3. This is a level where word-mearnings are stored. By contrast, word-forms are stored at a later level, the "lexeme" level. Evidence for the separation of the "lemma" and "lexeme" levels comes from tip-of-the-tongue phenomena, and phonological substitutions.</p>
<p>The lemma <strong>also</strong> contains the complement-selection properties of a word. This helps us to use the word in a sentence, e.g. by determining the structure of the sentence after the word.</p>
<p>Perhaps the strongest motivation for the lemma comes from languages where nouns have genders, e.g. masculine and feminine, e.g. French, Italian, Spanish. Data from patient "Dante" (Badecker et al. 1995), an individual with aphasia, suggests that the ability to report the gender of a word, is independent of the ability to name that word. This suggests the separation of the lemma and the lexeme.</p>
<p>Roughly-speaking the lemma contains <strong>modality-general</strong> information about a word, while the lexeme contains <strong>modality-specific</strong> information.</p>

<p>So far we have looked at words and morphemes. Now we are going to combine these into units called 'phrases'</p>
<p>A phrase is a <strong>group of words which behaves like a single single unit.</strong> The phrase tends to takes its name from the word which expresses the meaning of the phrase, e.g.</p>
<p>(i) Jack saw [a fascinating TV programme] -&gt; Phrase is about a programme, <em>programme</em> is a noun, therefore it is a NOUN PHRASE</p>
<p>(ii) Rufus likes drinking beer [in his local pub] -&gt; Phrase is about a location, the location is expressed by the preposition, therefore this is a PREPOSITIONAL PHRASE.</p>

<p>First three are most reliable.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Replacement test</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>A phrase can be replaced with 'placeholder' expression (e.g. a pronoun)</p>
<p>(a) [Elliot $<em>{NOUN~PHRASE}$] loved [the cute green alien $</em>{NOUN~PHRASE}$] -&gt; [He] loved [it]</p>
<p>(b) Elliot [hugged the cute green alien $<em>{VERB~PHRASE}$] and Gertie [did so $</em>{VERB~PHRASE}$] too (and [so did $_{VERB~PHRASE}$] Gertie)</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Question test</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>A phrase can be questioned</p>
<p>(a) Who did Elliot love? [ The cute green alien $_{NOUN PHRASE}$]</p>
<p>(b) Where did Elliot find ET? [ In the toolshed $_{PREPOSITIONAL~PHRASE}$ ]</p>
<p>(c) What is Elliot doing? [Hugging the cute green alien $_{VERB~PHRASE}$]</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Standalone test</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>When questioned, the phrase can stand alone as an answer (see above)</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Coordination test</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Phrases may be coordinated, i.e. they may be produced in a series linked by a coordinator (<em>and</em>, <em>but</em>, <em>or</em>) e.g.</p>
<p>(a) [Elliot <strong>and</strong> Gertie $<em>{NOUN~PHRASE}$] loved [the cute green alien <strong>and</strong> the soft brown Teddy $</em>{NOUN~PHRASE}$]</p>
<p>(b) Elliot [hugged the cute green alien <strong>and</strong> cuddled the soft brown Teddy $_{VERB~PHRASE}$]</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Movement test</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Phrases may, under circumstances move. If we attempt to move a group of words which is not a phrase, the sentence sound ungrammatical. Yoda (above) speak provides plenty of examples of the movement test, e.g.</p>
<p>(a) [Mourn them] do not _ . (Movement of Verb Phrase)</p>
<p>(b) [Consume you] it will _ . (Movement of Verb Phrase)</p>
<p>(c) [The dark side] I sense _ in you. (Movement of Noun Phrase)</p>
<p>(d) [Forever] it will dominate your destiny _ (Movement of Adverb Phrase. NB phrases can be single words. We can turn this into a multi-word phrase: <em>For the rest of time....</em>)</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Omission test</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Some phrases may be omitted. If a group of words may be omitted, it is likely to be a phrase, e.g. <em>The man (in the moon) came down (too soon)</em> (omission of prepositional phrase, and adverb phrase).</p>
<p>This test is probably the weakest test, as not all phrases may be omitted.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Filler test</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Fillers are words which we use to 'fill in' pauses. We tend to use them to 'cover up' disfluences. A classic example is 'like'. In general, fillers cannot be inserted within phrases, e.g.</p>
<ol>
<li>Elliot, <em>like</em>, loved the cute green alien (<em>like</em> inserted between phrases - sounds okay)</li>
<li>? Elliot loved the, <em>like</em>, cute green alien (<em>like</em> inserted within the Noun Phrase - sounds odd.)</li>
</ol>
<p>To remember these tests learn the following acronym: Really Quick Snakes Can Make Orangutans Flee</p>

<li>He is [good at playing chess]</li>

<p>According to the coordination test, replacement test, and the movement test, the verb is part of a bigger phrase consistent of the verb and following Noun Phrases, e.g.</p>
<ol>
<li>Patrick [loved the fish <strong>but</strong> hated the chips $_{VERB~PHRASE}$]</li>
<li>Mary [loved the mousse $<em>{VERB~PHRASE}$], and Shania [did so $</em>{VERB~PHRASE}$] too.</li>
<li>[Mourn them $<em>{VERB~PHRASE}$] do not _ . [Miss them $</em>{VERB~PHRASE}$] do not _ . Attachment leads to Jealousy.</li>
</ol>
<p>Notice that auxiliary verbs (and negative particles) are not part of the Noun Phrase (<em>[Mourn them $_{VP}$] </em><em>do</em><em> not, [Eaten them $_{VP}$] she </em><em>has</em><em> _</em> ).</p>
<p>But the Noun Phrases which come after the verb are also phrases. Therefore we have <strong>phrases inside phrases!</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Patrick [ loved [ the fish $<em>{NOUN~PHRASE}$] $</em>{VERB~PHRASE}$ ]</li>
</ol>
<p>This hierarchical structure (phrases-inside-phrases) is often expressed using syntactic trees (see lecture example)</p>
<p><strong>BE WARNED THAT DIFFERENT RESEARCH FIELDS USE THE TERM "VERB PHRASE" DIFFERENTLY</strong></p>
<p>Many clinicians and speech and language scientists use the term "Verb Phrase" to refer to the Verb and all associated words, e.g. <em>Mary </em><em>is greedily eating</em><em> the food</em>. This is also the definition which David Crystal uses. However, we will be using the definition preferred by linguists: the main verb and following Noun Phrases. This is because this unit meets the tests for phrasehood described above.</p>

<p>Look at the following speech errors. What does this say about the integration between (a) planning the structure of the sentence, and (b) inserting words in sentences, and (c) producing phonemes.</p>
<ol>
<li>I'm a weekend for maniacs.</li>
</ol>
<p>Conclusions:</p>
<ol>
<li>The sentence frame is appropriate but the words are in the wrong position. Therefore, it looks as if the sentence frame has been chosen before the words have been inserted</li>
<li>The voicing on maniacs is consistent with the previous consonant. Therefore the voicing rule has been applied after the word swap has taken place.</li>
<li>Combining these two observations, we have evidence for 3 stages: (1) a stage which involves the selection of the frame (2) a stage which involves the insertion of words (3) a phonetic stage where the phonetic realisation of affixes is determined.</li>

<li>Phonetic level - Insertion of variant lexemes/morphemes and syllabification</li>
<li>Articulatory level - Speech motor programme assembled.</li>

<p>A mental representation of the thoughts we wish to put into words. We know what <strong>entities</strong> we wish to talk about, and what kind of <strong>situation</strong> or <strong>event</strong> they are participating in. We must encode <strong>relational information</strong>, e.g. what is the relationship between an entity and an action? Is that entity the AGENT of the action, or the PATIENT of the action. At a later stage, the entities will be mapped onto <em>arguments</em>, while the situation/event will be mapped onto the <em>verb</em>.</p>
<p>In addition, to specifying entities and situations we take a particular <strong>perspective</strong> on the action. For example, we to decide which entity to <strong>focus</strong> on. Typically, the thing were are focusing on will come in non-subject position, will be specified with a full Noun Phrase (as opposed to a pronoun), and will take stress, e.g.</p>
<ol>
<li>I saw a strange man in the street. $[$ He $<em>{TOPIC}$ $]$ was wearing $[$ the weirdest clothes I've ever seen $</em>{FOCUS}$ $]$.</li>
</ol>
<p>We must also decide when the event took place (which will be expressed via <strong>tense</strong>), and how we wish to focus on the verb, e.g. do we wish to be inside the event, or outside the event. This is expressed as <strong>grammatical aspect</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li>John has chopped the carrot = PERFECTIVE aspect for completed event</li>
<li>John is chopping the carrot = PROGRESSIVE aspect for ongoing event</li>

<ol>
<li>She sneezed the napkin off the table</li>
</ol>
<p>The issue with this sentence is that <em>sneeze</em> is typically an intransitive verb which does not take an object. Here it takes an object (<em>the napkin</em>), and a Prepositional Phrase expressing location (<em>off the table</em>). This is a very unusual use of <em>sneeze</em>. However, the meaning is transparent, that our sneeze propells the napkin off the table. The question is how are we able to comprehenend and produce such an utterance?</p>
<ol>
<li>Traditional verb-centric story: we access the verb, then retrieve the argument structure from the lemma.</li>
</ol>
<p>PROBLEM: <em>sneeze</em> is unlikely to specify an argument structure with 3 entities. It is theoretically possible that we have a special meaning of sneeze in our lexicons, e.g. <em>sneeze</em> = make a sudden involuntary expulsion of air from the nose and mouth due to irritation of one's nostrils <u>such that the resulting air flow propels an object X from location Y</u>. But this is unlikely given the rarity of sentences with sneeze and three arguments.</p>
<ol>
<li>The meaning of the sentence comes, in part, form the sentence frame or 'construction'.</li>
</ol>
<p>The construction NP$_1$ + V + NP$_2$ + PP means <em>NP$_1$ acts upon NP$_2$ such that NP$_2$ changes location</em>. The verb is then 'squished' into the construction, and the two meanings (verb + construction) are 'fused'</p>
<p>By assuming that constructions have meaning, we can overcome a lot of problems with traditional Verb Argument Structure accounts.</p>

<p>We often use sentences with <em>more</em> arguments than the standard valency, e.g.</p>
<ol>
<li>She sneezed the napkin off the table (example above)</li>
<li>The naughty students laughed the teacher out of the room</li>
<li>She juggled her way to the semi-finals of the juggling contest</li>

<p>There are plenty of verbs which take arguments with 'weird' roles, e.e.g</p>
<ol>
<li><u>She</u> is happy</li>
<li><u>The table</u> needs a leg</li>
<li><u>That coat</u> suits <u>you</u></li>
<li><u>The coat</u> fits <u>me</u></li>
<li><u>She</u> swapped <u>her Porsche</u> for <u>a Ferrari</u>
   Both a Porsche and a Ferrari can be described as PATIENTS, but this undermines the principle that there is differentiation between the arguments</li>
<li><u>They</u> loaded <u>the truck</u> <u>with hay</u>
   Is <em>truck</em> a LOCATIVE or a PATIENT? If it is a PATIENT what kind of role does <em>hay</em> play? (assuming that all roles need to be differentiated?)</li>
</ol>
<p>None of these roles can be easily described using standard labels. There is no list of thematic relations which can account for all arguments in English, or indeed any language. This is despite many <strong>dozens</strong> of attempts by linguists.</p>

<p>Goldberg (1995) proposes that when we use verbs in setnences, we insert them into Verb Argument Structure Constructions (VAS Constructions). These are syntactic units with their own <strong>independent meaning</strong>. This can help explain both <strong>valency augmentation</strong> and <strong>weird thematic relations</strong>:</p>
<h2 id="lecture%20notes-xx%20-%20construction%20grammar-valency-augmentation">Valency augmentation<a class="headerlink" href="#lecture%20notes-xx%20-%20construction%20grammar-valency-augmentation" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Here are the two possible solutions:</p>
<ol>
<li>The multiple sense account. We have different senses of verbs in our lexicons, some of which allow extra arguments. e.g. there is a lexical entry for <em>sneeze</em> which allows for three arguments</li>
<li>The construction based account. The extra argument is specified by the construction itself.</li>
</ol>
<p>The multiple sense account is highly implausible. Given how rare it is to use <em>sneeze</em> with three arguments, it is very unlikely that we have such a representation in the lexicon.</p>
<h2 id="lecture%20notes-xx%20-%20construction%20grammar-weird-thematic-relations">Weird thematic relations<a class="headerlink" href="#lecture%20notes-xx%20-%20construction%20grammar-weird-thematic-relations" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>If roles are (in part) given by the construction itself, we are not committed to a small and finite set of roles. For example we could posit the following constructions:</p>
<ol>
<li>The copula construction:
   FORM: X is Y
   FUNCTION 1: X denotes the same referent as Y (e.g. One man's terrorist is another man's Freedom Fighter)
   FUNCTION 2: Y describes a property of X (e.g. Die hard is a great Xmas film)
   FUNCTION 3 (where X and Y are identical): X/Y has a property which is relevant to the current discussion (e.g. It wasn't a great film, but hey, George Clooney is George Clooney)</li>
<li>The "needing" construction:
   FORM: X + needing verb + Y
   FUNCTION: X needs Y (e.g. we're going to need a bigger boat, this task requires a bigger boat, this task necessitates a bigger boat)</li>
<li>The fit/suit construction:
   FORM: X + fit/suit + Y.
   FUNCTION: X (an item of clothing) looks good on Y (a person)</li>
</ol>

<p>But surely the verbs must provide a role as well? Yes, verbs specify roles which are <strong>highly specific to that verb</strong>, while the VAS Construction specifies roles <strong>which are more general</strong>. When using a verb with a particular VAS Construction, we need to "fuse" the verb-specific role in the former, with the more general role in the latter.</p>

<p>Many of the roles specified by VAS Constructions correspond to widely used traditional labels such as "AGENT" and "PATIENT", but many do not (e.g. the subject of the copula, or the subject of <em>need</em>).</p>
<p>Some roles appear to be more general than others because they</p>
<ol>
<li>Occur in VAS Constructions with very general/abstract meanings and which allow lots of different verbs, e.g. AGENT + VERB + PATIENT</li>
<li>Describe slots with similar meanings in related constructions, e.g.
   THEME + VERB + EXP. = She scares me, They please George, The play entertained me
   EXP. + VERB + THEME = I fear her, George likes them, I enjoyed the play</li>
</ol>

<p>The idea of VAS constructions contradicts with traditional "words and rules" approaches to grammar. According to these approaches, words are combined using rules, and then are semantically interpreted, e.g.</p>
<ol>
<li>RULE: VP &lt;- V + NP</li>
<li>RULE: Sentence &lt;- NP + VP</li>
</ol>
<p>INTERPRETATION: A situation involving two NPs whose roles are determined by the verb.</p>
<p>Late semantic interpretation can be explained by the fact that we always try to identify a meaning as long as the sentence is well formed, e.g.</p>
<ol>
<li>Colourless green ideas sleep furiously</li>
</ol>
<p>Words and rules approaches draw a categorical distinction between syntax (combinatorial rules) and the lexicon (repository of meaning)</p>
<p>However, according to Goldberg, syntactic constructions can also be meaningful. This breaks down the distinction between syntax and the lexicon. According to Goldberg, they are all part of the same system. Words involve mapping between form and meaning. Constructions also involve a mapping between form and meaning.</p>

<ol>
<li>You mean, I've got Arthritis Arthritis!!??
   FORM: The noun is repeated.
   MEANING: There is a scale of <strong>authenticity</strong> ranging from N to N + N (Arthritis to Arthritis Arthritis). N + N (Arthritis Arthritis) is at the high end of this scale.</li>
<li>There are burgers, and then there are burgers
   FORM: <em>There is/are</em> + NP <em>and then there is/are</em> + NP
   MEANING: There is a scale of <strong>authenticity</strong>, with the second NP at the top of the scale.</li>
<li>Now watch me go and drop this cake!
   FORM: Now watch + Clause (with nonfinite verb)
   MEANING: Sometimes called the "<strong>tempting fate</strong>" construction. It means I hope X DOESN'T happen, e.g. I hope I DON'T drop this cake.</li>
<li>She worked her way to the top of the class
   FORM: Subject + Verb + Possessive determiner (his, her, its) + "way" + PREPOSITIONAL PHRASE
   MEANING: X arrived at location Z by means of action Y. Progress is <strong>difficult</strong>, and the path is <strong>circuitous</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>These all display correspondences between form and meaning. The meanings are not predictable from general linguistic rules, i.e. they are non-compositional.</p>

<p>According to the Words and Rules Approach</p>
<ol>
<li>There is a categorical distinction between words (meaning) and rules (form)</li>
<li>Linguistic knowledge consists of (a) lexical knowledge, and (b) syntactic knowledge (ability to combine words)</li>
<li>Semantic interpretation of a sentence is seperate (and subsequent to) syntactic interpretation</li>
</ol>
<p>According to Construction Grammar accounts</p>
<ol>
<li>Words and syntactic constructions are all part of the <strong>same system</strong>, sometimes called the "Constructicon"</li>
<li>Linguistic knowledge = knowledge of constructions (words can be described as "minimal constructions")</li>
<li>Semantics and syntax are inseparable (as syntactic constructions are meaningful)</li>
</ol>

<p>Some syntactic phenomena do not appear to be linked to meaning, e.g. subject + verb agreement.</p>

<p>When teaching children grammatical constructions we need to higlight the <strong>meaning</strong> of those constructions. E.g. Riches (2013) highlights the meaning of the passive construction (the verb is highly affected), e.g.</p>
<ol>
<li>The vase was smashed by the dog (Vase is highly affected)</li>
</ol>
<p>This is reflected in children's early use of the passive. We very rarely have passives in which the subject is not highly affected, e.g.</p>
<ol>
<li>It was dreamt about.</li>
</ol>

<p>What is wrong with the following sentences?</p>
<ol>
<li>Jack gave Mary</li>
<li>Petula put the beans</li>
<li>Julie laughed Peter</li>
</ol>
<p>Verbs select the number of entities in the sentence. <em>Give</em> and <em>put</em> select 3 participants, but there are only 2 in the sentence. <em>Laugh</em> selects 1 participant, but there are 2 in the sentence.</p>

<p>What is the valence of the following verbs?</p>
<ol>
<li>Drive</li>
<li>Donate</li>
<li>Mix</li>
<li>Yawn</li>
<li>Slap</li>
<li>Rain</li>
</ol>
<p>A verb 'begs to be completed into a sentence' (Tomasello, 1992)</p>
<p>The verb implies a certain number of participants (Valence)</p>
<p>Valence can range from 0 to 3.</p>
<p>Psycholinguistic studies demonstrate that even when we hear verbs in isolation we mentally represent the number of participants (e.g. Shapiro et al. 1987 lexical decision task, or Kim &amp; Thomson, 2000)</p>
<h2 id="lecture%20notes-xx%20-verbs%20in%20the%20driving%20seat-thematic-relations-roles">Thematic relations (roles)<a class="headerlink" href="#lecture%20notes-xx%20-verbs%20in%20the%20driving%20seat-thematic-relations-roles" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Look at the following sentences:</p>
<ol>
<li>Jane fears Peter</li>
<li>Peter scares Jane</li>
<li>Paul liked the play</li>
<li>The play pleased Paul</li>
<li>Mary gave Pete a present</li>
<li>Pete received a present from Mary</li>
</ol>
<p>We can see that in order to use a verb properly, knowing the valence is not enough. We need to know which roles come in which positions. Otherwise we will get the meaning of the sentence wrong, e.g. we will say <em>Jane scares Peter</em>.</p>
<p>Consequently, when using a verb in a sentence, we need to know (a) the number of participants, (b) their roles in the sentence, and (c) how those roles are ordered.</p>
<h1 id="lecture%20notes-xx%20-verbs%20in%20the%20driving%20seat-argument-structure">Argument structure<a class="headerlink" href="#lecture%20notes-xx%20-verbs%20in%20the%20driving%20seat-argument-structure" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>

<p>Information included in the lexical entry of the verb, which  specifies (a) the number of essential participants (valence), (b) their roles, and (c) the order of those roles.</p>
<p>Essential participants are known as 'arguments'</p>
<p>Argument structure is partly semantic / partly syntactic:</p>
<ol>
<li>Semantic level: roles specified by the verb</li>
<li>Syntactic level: ordering of roles</li>
</ol>
<p>Non-essential participants are often classified as adverbials</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>She beat the eggs [ with a whisk ]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She topped the cake [ with cream ]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She ate the bananas [ with custard ]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She scoffed the cake [ with her best friend ]</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Which of the `with' phrases describe an essential participant? Could the event take place without it?</p>

<p>How do we determine <strong>essential</strong> participants? Those which are obligatory? We can test for obligatoriness by omitting an presumed argument, and seeing how this impacts on grammaticality</p>
<ol>
<li>She dropped <del>the pen</del></li>
<li>She took <del>the jacket</del></li>
</ol>
<p>But most arguments can be rendered optional in certain contexts</p>
<ol>
<li>She give $[$ money $]$ to charity</li>
<li>They all gave presents to Mary. Paul gave a pen (to Mary), Jenny gave a book (to Mary), and Brad gave a watch (to Mary)</li>
<li>COOKING INSTRUCTIONS: Chop (the carrots) and stir (them) into the sauce</li>
</ol>
<p>So obligatoriness will only get you so far!</p>
<p>In addition, some verbs seem to elicit a wide variety of arguments</p>
<ol>
<li>$[$ He $]$ paints $[$ walls $]$</li>
<li>$[$ He $]$ painted $[$ the wall $]$ $[$ red $]$</li>
<li>$[$ He $]$ painted $[$ the wall $]$ $[$ red $]$ $[$ with a paintbrush $]$ and $[$ some paint $]$</li>
<li>$[$ This brush $]$ paints well</li>
</ol>
<p>There are many potential arguments. Which ones are essential?</p>
<p>Finally sometimes verbs can take "extra-valent" arguments which sound "added on"</p>
<ol>
<li>She swam $[$ ten lengths $]$</li>
<li>They laughed $[$ the teacher $]$  $[$ out of the room $]$</li>
</ol>
<p>There is no foolproof way to determine valency</p>
<ol>
<li>Method 1: Work out which arguments are "nearly" obligatory by looking at at a corpus</li>
<li>Method 2: Introspection. Shut your eyes and imagine the verb. How many entities are in the mental scene you have just conjured.</li>
</ol>
<p>These two methods can occasionally give different results!</p>
<p>So there is no knock down method. If in doubt, shut your eyes, and click your heels together!</p>

<p>Why not just assume that the way we use words in sentences is a direct result of their meanings? This approach is sometimes described as a <em>projectionist</em> approach. 2 problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Examples above (<em>Jane fears Peter / Peter scares Jane</em>) suggest that each verb must specify the order of the roles. A syntactic level of representation is arguably required for this, as we can't work out the order of arguments from the verb meaning (<em>fear</em> and <em>scare</em> arguably convey the same situation, with the only difference being the order of arguments)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Verbs specify detailed information about sentence structure which is not obviously linked to their meaning, e.g. <em>say</em> versus <em>tell</em> have almost identical meanings, but are used in sentences in very different ways:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th>Say</th>
<th>Tell</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>VERB + NOUN PHRASE</td>
<td>He said his name</td>
<td>X</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>VERB + CLAUSE (mini sentence)</td>
<td>He said [that he was hungry]</td>
<td>X</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>VERB + NOUN PHRASE + CLAUSE</td>
<td>X</td>
<td>He told his friend that he was angry</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>These meanings can be "boiled down" to a difference in argument structure (or more specifically <em>valency</em>). The main difference appears to be that <em>say</em> takes 2 arguments, while <em>tell</em> takes 3 arguments.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Verbs with very similar meanings have very different argument structure configurations, e.g.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He gave a book to Mary / He gave her the book</p>
</li>
<li>He donated a book to the library / *He donated the library a book</li>
</ol>
<p>If we were just inferring a verb's syntactic behaviour from its meaning, we would have no way to account for this. (NB it's not sure how argument structure can account for this either)</p>
<h1 id="lecture%20notes-xx%20-verbs%20in%20the%20driving%20seat-propositions">Propositions<a class="headerlink" href="#lecture%20notes-xx%20-verbs%20in%20the%20driving%20seat-propositions" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>The verb and its arguments from a <em>proposition</em>.</p>
<p>A proposition is a <em>mental scene</em> involving at least one <em>participant</em> (or argument) participating in an event or situation (expressed by the verb, or "predicate")</p>
<p>A proposition contains those entities which make the most important contributions to the <strong>truth conditions</strong> of the sentence (the real world conditions under which the sentence is true). Nouns (arguments) and verbs make a major contribution to truth conditions, e.g.</p>
<ol>
<li>The <strong>dog chased</strong> the cat -&gt; The <strong>robot washed</strong> the cat: TRUTH CONDITIONS HAVE COMPLETELY CHANGED</li>
<li>The dog chased <strong>the</strong> cat -&gt; The dog <strong>quickly</strong> chased <strong>a</strong> cat: MINOR CHANGE TO TRUTH CONDITIONS</li>
</ol>
<p>Propositions come at the bottom of a three way heirarchy:</p>
<ol>
<li>Propositional level</li>
</ol>
<p>chase(dog,cat)</p>
<ol>
<li>Sentence level</li>
</ol>
<p>a. The dog chased the cat</p>
<p>b. It chased the cat</p>
<p>c. The cat was chased by the dog</p>
<ol>
<li>Utterance level</li>
</ol>
<p>A: Is your dog energetic?
   B: Well, it chases the neighbour's cat every day!</p>
<p>We need propositions to explain how different surface forms (e.g. 2) can have the same underlying meaning. The proposition IS the underlying meaning.</p>

<p>Phrases which describe locations are sometimes called LOCATIVES, e.g.</p>
<ol>
<li>Jason is <strong>in the park</strong> $_{LOC}$</li>
<li>Pat loaded the hay <strong>onto the wagon</strong> $_{LOC}$</li>
</ol>
<p>But be careful for a LOCATIVE to be a genuine argument, it has to be selected by the verb. In the following sentences</p>
<ol>
<li>The girls played baseball <strong>in the park</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>the phrase <em>in the park</em> is not technically an argument because it is not chosen by the verb. However, researchers and clinicians have a tendency to label these non-arguments as arguments! How completely sloppy!</p>
<p>We can make questions about locatives using the question word <em>where</em>, e.g.</p>
<ol>
<li>Q: Where is Jason? A: In the park.</li>

<p>An instrument is an object used to perform and action, e.g.</p>
<ol>
<li>Angela covered the food <strong>with a cloth</strong> $_{INSTR}$</li>
</ol>
<p>This is actually a dubious candidate for a genuine thematic relation. If a verb requires a specific instrument, the instrument is often made explicit in the verb, e.g.</p>
<ol>
<li>He <strong>hammered</strong> the nail (with a hammer)</li>
<li>She <strong>filed</strong> her nails (with a nail file).</li>
</ol>
<p>If a verb does not require a specific instrument, it is expressed using <em>with</em>, e.g.</p>
<ol>
<li>He scratched his back <strong>with a loofah</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This is arguably not an essential participant in the scratching action, and this kind of phrase is always omissible. So it probably shouldn't be categorised as an argumnet (but many people do!)</p>
