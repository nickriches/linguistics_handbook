This effect is called the \u201ctesting effect\u201d, and a learning strategy which depends on continually testing yourself is called \u201ctest-enhanced\u201d learning. Amazingly, there is good evidence that the very act of testing yourself is beneficial, even if you do not successfully recall the relevant information (Kornell et al., 2015; Kornell & Vaughn, 2016; Vaughn et al., 2017). This is pretty extraordinary and suggests that time spent studying at your desk is never wasted, even if you are struggling to recall the material. The way that you test yourself depends on the material you are learning. For example, if testing new words in a foreign language you could have a card with the word in your first language (e.g. English) on one side, and the word in the target language (e.g. French) on the other side. You can work your way through the pack, read the English word, try to recall the French word, and test your knowledge by turning over the card. You could also do this process in reverse, e.g. look at the French word, and try to translate this into English. The more active we are in the way we test ourselves, the better we learn and retain the information. Regarding the flashcard example above, the more active form of learning is to read the English word, and try to recall the French word. However, though the alternative process, translating from French to English is less active, it may be beneficial in certain contexts, e.g. for quick revision. Some forms of learning are much more abstract not amenable to flashcards. An example of this is your understanding of the word class Noun. You could revise this in a variety of ways, e.g. - Provide a definition , but with a word missing, e.g. A Noun is word which often refers to a ___ (thing). It is often preceded by a ___ (Determiner) - Create a multiple choice question , e.g. In the following sentence, which of the following properties does not describe a Noun It takes the suffix -ing \u2714 It takes the suffix -s (in the regular form) It is often prceded by a detrminer - Create an open-ended \u201clist\u201d question , e.g. \u201cList three properties of a Noun\u201d (Possible answers: it tends to refer to a thing, it inflects for plural, e.g. horses , it comes after a determiner, e.g. the horse , it \u201cagrees\u201d with a verb, e.g. the horse runs, the horses run_ etc.) - Create a completely open-ended question , e.g. \u201cWhat is a definition of a noun\u201d? Which of these you think promotes more active learning? Evidence suggests that the more open-ended questions lead to better learning because they involve active recall of the material rather than recognition of the right answer (Kang et al., 2007). This doesn\u2019t mean that multiple-choice questions are bad for study \u2013 they can be very beneficial. For example, there are clear right or wrong answers, unlike open-ended questions, and this can help you decide whether you need to revise a particular topic. They are also less time-consuming than open-ended questions. A good revision strategy would probably contain a mix of different types of revision prompts, e.g. flashcards, multiple-choice questions, open-ended list questions, and completely open-ended questions. Why note-taking is a key skill \u00b6 Words are concrete and easy to test using flashcard systems. For other kinds of knowledge, e.g. abstract theories, flashcards are too crude and simplistic, so you\u2019ll need to find other ways to test yourself. For example, you could write the key claims of the theory on a piece of paper, number these, and using the numbers as prompts try to recall each claim one by one. This kind of works, but it is clear that the more abstract and complex a knowledge domain becomes, the more difficult it is to think of ways to test yourself. While you are thinking about clever procedures to test yourself on everything you need to know, just start taking some notes. Take a blank sheet of paper, or open up a note-taking app, and try to recall everything you need to know in note form. By taking notes you are having to actively recall and process the information you have learnt. For example, because you are incapable of rapidly writing down everything the lecturer says (unless you are a word-record typist or short-hand expert), you are having to identify the most important points when notetaking. Also, because human memory for linguistic form is generally weaker than our memory for linguistic meaning, you will have to write down the main points of the lecture in your own words, and in this way you are having to actively process the information. An additional benefit of note-taking is that you can easily show the structure of the material you are learning using headings and subheadings. All of the material you learn will have some kind of structure, e.g. a theory might consist of three key arguments, and the ICF clinical framework consists of four areas of functioning. Lectures themselves will be organised into discrete sections. Moreover, there is evidence to suggest that information is more adequately processed and retained when it is explicitly integrated into a larger structure. For example the regular use of headings and subheadings in written passages helps the reader to read more quickly and accurately, and recall more information (Hy\u00f6n\u00e4 & Lorch, 2004; Lorch & Lorch, 1996; Sanchez et al., 2001). However, while the information you are given fits into an overarching structure, the technology which is used to deliver lectures is not great for showing structure. Powerpoint does not show structure very well, as it invites the user to create a continuous chain of slides. Sometimes lecturers add \u201cTable of Contents\u201d slides, but this is not that widely practised. By making notes you can actually impose structure on the material you are learning, using headings and subheadings, and this will help you to learn that material. The Cornell note-taking system \u00b6 A good tried and tested note-taking system is called \u201cCornell Notes\u201d, which was devised by Prof. Walter Pauk of Cornell University in the 1950s. If you do an internet search you will find loads of materials on this approach. Here is one link to start you off. Why writing notes on slides may not be helpful \u00b6 Lecturers often supply their students with handouts containing the slides. Many students write on these handouts, and believe that this is an appropriate way to learn. But what is the evidence that this is a good learning approach? Existing studies investigating the impact of slide-based handouts have found that students learn better without them (Kim, 2018; Worthington & Levasseur, 2015). Why might this be the case? Firstly, if the slides contain a substantial amount of text, you are less likely to convert what you have learnt into your own words. Your notes will become shorter. They will become comments on the slides, rather than a full paraphrase of what you have just heard. Consequently, you will be learning in a more passive manner. Secondly, as mentioned above, it is quite difficult to signpost structure within slides. By contrast, if you make notes on a blank piece of paper it is easier to show structure by writing your own subheadings. So, I just need to make good notes? \u00b6 Yes, good note-taking is the place to start, but you also need to explore other ways to test yourself. As mentioned, flashcards may be very useful. For example, for anatomy, you could have a picture of a part of the body on one side, and the label on the other. You can look at the picture, and then attempt to recall the label. If you are correct, put it in the correct pile, and if you are incorrect, or cannot recall it, put it in the incorrect pile. There is quite interesting evidence to suggest that if you correctly recall something once, you are likely to recall it successfully in the future (Bahrick et al., 1993). Therefore, you can learn very efficiently just by repeatedly testing yourself on the items in the incorrect pile. Also, make sure that, when you test yourself, you do it at fairly widely-spaced intervals. This principle is known as \u201cdistributed learning\u201d or the \u201cspacing effect\u201d, and there is a lot of evidence that it is beneficial for learning in an academic setting (Dempster, 1988). Naturally, flashcards are only amenable to certain kinds of topics. For more abstract topics (e.g. Linguistics, Psychology), and you will need to find other ways to test yourself, e.g. by creating your own questions / prompts. What to do with all this technology? \u00b6 There is a whole host of technology out there for you to explore when it comes to taking notes, or creating flashcards. Below I have described a few apps that I am aware of, but there must be many more out there that I\u2019ve missed; Note-taking \u00b6 OneNote \u2013 this has the advantage that it integrates well with other Microsoft products, e.g. emailing, calendar, and Teams Notion (https://www.notion.so) \u2013 possibly the most widely used non-Microsoft note-taking app. It\u2019s also great as a general organisational app. Its basic plan is free. Roam Research (https://roamresearch.com) \u2013 High-concept, and slightly geeky app, frequently touted as \u201cthe next big thing\u201d. It\u2019s online only, and expensive, but students can get free plans. Evernote (https://evernote.com) \u2013 Simple app, which works both online and locally Apple Notes - If you are an Apple afficionado. Flashcards \u00b6 Quizlet (https://quizlet.com/en-gb) \u2013 online flashcard app. Anki (https://apps.ankiweb.net) \u2013 open source cross-platform flashcard app. It has a bit of a steep learning curve. All-in-one technologies \u00b6 These are technologies which incorporate note-taking and flashcards in a single app. The idea is that you can use them to take notes, and quickly generate flashcards to test yourself. Remnote (https://www.remnote.com) \u2013 Very user-friendly, online but also with a local app. It is explicitly designed for students. However, make sure you regularly back up your data to your local computer and don\u2019t leave it sitting in the cloud (Remnote provides an easy way to do this). Obsidian - (https://obsidian.md) - Very popular note-taking app with revision features incorporated via plugins. Logseq (https://logseq.com) \u2013 Wonderful open-source notetaking and general organisational app. However, the learning curve is steeper than remnote. A big advantage is that you have complete ownership of your data. Roam Research \u2013 As mentioned above. Roam also has good tools for creating question banks. Further reading \u00b6 \u201cMake it stick: the science of succesful learning\u201d (Brown, Roediger III, McDaniel) is a popular science book written by leading experts in the field which covers many of the above ideas, e.g. test-enhanced learning, distributed practice. The website which accompanies the book (https://www.retrievalpractice.org/make-it-stick) also contains lots of really cool infographics to demonstrate the main ideas. Check it out!

When we speak, our thoughts are straightforwardly converted to linguistic symbols, which are encoded in the speech signal. The hearer decodes this signal to arrive at the speaker's thoughts. Animals are capable of using code-like communication systems, e.g. the waggle dance which bees use. This encodes the direction of the source of pollen (direction bee is pointing), and also the distance of the hive (time spent waggling). Is language a code? \u00b6 It is tempting to view language as a code-like system, and in many ways it is code-like. But in other ways it is completely different, e.g. A: Did you like the meal at the restaurant? B: The starters were good. B would infer that the rest of the meal was not good. This message is not explicitly encoded in the speech signal. So language does not operate like a code. We often use inference to derive the meaning of the utterance. Inference is a type of informed guesswork , which we can use to derive meanings which are not explicit (i.e. not present in the speech signal). What is pragmatics? \u00b6 Definition \u00b6 Pragmatics is the study of inferred meaning . Difference between pragmatics and semantics \u00b6 (a) The sentence versus the utterance \u00b6 Pragmatics can be contrasted with semantics which is the study of encoded meaning . While semantics is concerned with the sentence , i.e. a series of linguistic symbols which is devoid of context, pragmatics is concerned with the utterance , i.e. sentences which are produced in a specific context. This context encompasses who said the utterances, how the utterance was being used in a conversation, and whether there are any intentions behind the utterance. In other words, the utterances is a specific sentence produced in a particular context , at a particular moment , by a particular speaker . Here are two examples to demonstrate this difference The bin is full Its explicit meaning is merely the proposition that THE BIN IS FULL. It may have a number of implicit meanings depending on context. When my other half tells me that the bin is full, she really means that I need to empty the bin because it is overflowing, and the dogs will start eating the rubbish. I'm a bit short of cash. Its explicit meaning is the proposition that THE SPEAKER DOES NOT HAVE MUCH MONEY. But it can have a number of implicit meanings depending on the context. For example, if someone has just asked \"Are you going to take the job?\" it probably means \"Yes.\" If someone has just asked \"Are you coming to the pub?\" it probably means \"No.\" When pragmaticists (people who study pragmatics) refer to context, it can take on a variety of meanings: Type of context Definition Linguistic context Relationship of utterance to what has been previously said (discourse). E.g. is the utterance said in reply to a question Physical context Physical context in which the environment takes place, e.g. is the speaker pointing at something? Interpersonal context Speakers\u2019 shared knowledge. What the speakers know about each other\u2019s beliefs, goals and mental states. What the speakers are trying to do to each other, e.g. inform, apologise, persuade Social / cultural context Social roles of speakers / social status of speakers / cultural norms. E.g. if you started an interview with \"Hey dude!\" you probably wouldn't get the job (b) Truth-conditionality \u00b6 Have a look at this exchange A: What did you think of the meal? B: The starters were good. A: So the rest of the meal wasn't very nice? B: No, that was nice too! We can see that after B's first utterance, A would most likely make the inference that the rest of the meal wasn't good. But they decide to double-check this inference. B then replies that the rest of the meal was in fact good. (NB you could argue that B is not being a very pragmatically sophisticated communicator as they have allowed A to make an inference which is not true, but this kind of situation often happens!) This example demonstrates the difference between truth-conditional and non-truth-conditional meaning. The explicit / encoded meaning of \"The starters were good\" is the proposition that THE STARTERS WERE GOOD. This is truth-conditional as it is capable of being true or false (depending on whether the starters were good). However, the inference that the rest of the meal wasn't very nice is not truth-conditional, because we can see that it can be cancelled by the speaker (B). We describe inferences as being defeasible or cancellable . Semantics is the study of truth-conditional meaning, while pragmatics is the study of non-truth-conditional meaning. The range of pragmatics \u00b6 Pragmatics covers a massive range of linguistic phenomena ranging from simple to complex inferences. An example of a simple inference is reference assignment , e.g. \"Have you met John? He 's my best friend.'\" We are most likely to infer that he refers to John because it is the most recently mentioned Noun Phrase. However, it could feasibly refer to a different entity. An example of a complex inference is figurative language such as metaphor . When Princess Diana spoke about her close relationship with her butler, Paul Burrell, she referred to him as \"her rock \", i.e. someone she could depend on. However, in a different context, it may mean something completely different, e.g. if someone says \"you are like a rock \" to their romantic partner, it probably means they are being cold, distant and withdrawn (NB technically this is simile , but it is closely related to metaphor). Metaphor is much more complex than reference-assignment as it involves making connections between literal and nonliteral meanings. In addition, to covering a wide range of phenomena, the term \"pragmatics\" means different things to different people. When linguists use the term they tend to refer to \"linguistic pragmatics\", i.e. the process o interpreting utterances in context using linguistic inference. However, it is also used to describe someone's general communicative / conversational ability, e.g. their ability to use turn-taking, their ability to create coherent discourses (i.e. they don't suddenly switch topic). A speech and language therapist is more likely to use the latter definition. Basic concepts in pragmatics \u00b6 Basic concepts I: Intention recognition \u00b6 Being able to read the intention behind an utterance is a fundamental prerequisite of pragmatic communication. We can see this at play when interpretation speech errors, e.g. Could you pass me the salad? (English lanaguage learner intends to say \"salt\") Did you see the alligator? (Produced by a tourist taking a cruise down the Nile) I he left it in the par cark (Sound swap) In each of these contexts you probably would not try to correct the speaker as their intended meaning is very clear. To demonstrate the importance of intention recognition think about this example: It is a beautiful day in the mountains with some light cloud. A tourist says to the inn keeper \"I'm going for a walk up the mountain\". The inn keeper replies \"It's starting to get cloudy.\" Clearly the inn keeper is trying to warn the tourist. Possible inferences are (a) the inn keeper knows that it will take a long time to get to the top, so it\u2019s best to be prepared for bad weather, (b) the inn keeper knows that the weather on the mountain is unpredictable (c) the inn keeper knows that in this part of the world, light cloud in the morning tends to turn into rain by midday. These are all very important inferences to make, or the tourist could get into trouble! Note that these inferences can only arise if the tourist is attempting to read the intention behind the utterances, i.e. the inn keeper is intending to warn the tourist. Language is a form of \u2018 intentional communication \u2019. This is because interpreting an utterance involves not just decoding the truth-conditional meaning, but inferring the intention behind the utterance Basic concepts II: Choosing the right assumptions (premises) \u00b6 Take a look at this example A: Would you like a coffee? B: Coffee would keep me awake. How one interprets this depends on what assumptions one makes. If A assumes that B would like to go to bed (e.g. to get a good night's sleep before an exam), then they would interpret their utterance as meaning \"no\". If A assumes that B would like to stay awake (e.g. to do some last minute cramming), then they would interpret their utterance as meaning \"yes\". Basic concepts III: Choosing the right interpretation \u00b6 However, even if we have access to all the relevant contextual information, sometimes we do not make the right interpretation, e.g. A: What do you intend to do today? B: I have a terrible headache. Here are all the possible inferences that A could make: B feels too unwell to decide what to do, B feels too unwell to answer the question, B plans to pop out to get some aspirin, B plans to spend the rest of the day in bed. The riskiness of pragmatic communication \u00b6 Because it is not always possible to read the speaker's intentions, access the right assumptions (premises), or choose the right interpretation, pragmatic communication is fraught with risk . An interesting question is why humans have developed a communication system in which communication breakdowns are so likely to occur. Austin's Speech Act Theory \u00b6 The basics \u00b6 This was pioneered by J.L. Austin in his 1962 book \"How to do things with words.\" It was one of the first pragmatic theories to address the issue of intention recognition . According to his approach we \"do things\" with sentences, e.g. we say sentences to warn , inform , or persuade . The thing we do with the sentence is the speech act or illocution . There is a finite list of possible speech acts, which makes the task of identifying the appropriate illocution much easier. We can determine the speech act of a sentence if we paraphrase it using a performative verb (a verb which expresses the speech act), e.g. Would you like to come to the party? \u2192 The speaker is inviting the addressee to come to a party. Interpreting the speech act involves paraphrasing the sentence using a performative verb. This is the performative hypothesis . (NB sometimes the performative verb may be explicitly stated, e.g. \"I would like to invite you to the party\" but most of the time the performative verb is left implicit). Austin conceptualises the utterance on three different levels. In the middle is the speech act or illocution. This proceeds from the locution (the explicit / truth-conditional meaning of the utterance). There is also a level the perlocution which is the general (as opposed to specific) goal of the utterance and its overall effect on the listener. Here is an example for the utterance I'll tidy my room : Level Name Definition Description 1 Locution Explicit content The speaker will tidy their room at some point in the future 2 Illocution (or Speech Act) What the speaker \"does\" with the utterance He PROMISED he would tidy his room 3 Perlocution General goal and overall effect on listener The child wants to impress their parents (and maybe increase the probability that they will be allowed to watch a horror film) According to Austin, illocutions / speech acts are chosen from a finite list. Here is list he proposed: Greeting, Promise, Congratulation, Threat, Question (aka \u2018request for information\u2019), Comment, Offer, Attention getter, Request, Command. He referred to the last three as directives . The choice of speech act will depend on the context. e.g. the sentence \"There is some cake on the table\" could be, a complaint to the waiter in a caf\u00e9, a warning not to let the dog into the room where the cake is, an invitation to take some of the cake, an accusation made against a fridge-raiding teenager. Felicity conditions \u00b6 To help choose the appropriate speech act, each carries a set of felicity conditions , i.e. conditions which need to be met for the speech act to acheive its purpose (perlocution), e.g. Sentence Speech act Felicity conditions I pronounce you man and wife An act of \"marrying\" The person who says this must have the relevant authority I'm so sorry An apology The apology must be genuine and heartelt (e.g. compare with an ironic apology: \"I'm so SOH-ree!\") Come to a party! An invitation Speaker and hearer are friends or there is a potential for friendship Did you do the homework? A (genuine) question The speaker does not have a particular piece of information. They think that the hearer is likely to have that information. The speaker wishes to find out that piece of information. The felicity conditions can help determine the speech act. E.g. if a lecturer asks \"What is a preposition?\", this violates the felicity conditions for a genuine question, as the lecturer is likely to know the answer. This causes the student to interpret this question as a RHETORICAL QUESTION, i.e. not a genuine question. Pros and cons \u00b6 The provides an account of how we determine the underlying intention behind the utterances, which is clearly very important in pragmatic communication. However, it is not clear that there is a finite limit on the different types of speech acts. It also does not allow for phatic communication , when we use language purely with the intention to build a relationship with the hearer, e.g. \"It's a lovely day today isn't it?\". Here there is an evident perlocution, to start a conversation, but no clear illocution.","title":"Introduction to Pragmatics and SA Theory"},{"location":"Linguistics%201%20lecture%20notes/01%20Pragmatics%20introduction/#introduction-to-pragmatics-and-sa-theory","text":"","title":"Introduction to Pragmatics and SA Theory"},{"location":"Linguistics%201%20lecture%20notes/01%20Pragmatics%20introduction/#the-code-view-of-language","text":"","title":"The code view of language"},{"location":"Linguistics%201%20lecture%20notes/01%20Pragmatics%20introduction/#what-is-the-code-view","text":"According to this view language consists of symbols which allow perfect transmission of the message we are conveying.

E.g. if a lecturer asks \"What is a preposition?\", this violates the felicity conditions for a genuine question, as the lecturer is likely to know the answer. This causes the student to interpret this question as a RHETORICAL QUESTION, i.e. not a genuine question.","title":"Felicity conditions"},{"location":"Linguistics%201%20lecture%20notes/01%20Pragmatics%20introduction/#pros-and-cons","text":"The provides an account of how we determine the underlying intention behind the utterances, which is clearly very important in pragmatic communication.

Crossing over \u00b6 While it is tempting to think in neat subfields, many phenomena cross over e.g. The meaning of verbs (semantics) determines the number of participants in a sentence, which in turn determines the structure (syntax). John [1] gave Mary [2] a book [3] Because of these cross-over phenomena, linguists often talk about the 'interfaces' between the different subdomains, e.g. the syntax-semantic interface. Subfields of linguistics \u00b6 Theoretical linguistics : investigates the nature of linguistic knowledge. IMPORTANT QUESTIONS: Are we born with knowledge of language? How do we explain similarities and differences across languages? Psycholinguistics : investigates how we comprehend and produce language. IMPORTANT QUESTIONS: Is the human mind similar to desktop computer? Does the language we speak affect the way we think? Sociolinguistics : investigates how and why language varies across different social classes and groupings. E.g. William Labov's famous (1963) study of Martha's Vinyard. He studies centralisation of diphthongs (multi-sound vowels). He pioneered methods to elicit relevant words without using word lists. He found an association between self-identification as a native and use of centralisation. Centralisation increased in response to an influx of non-natives. This shows that the language we use \"indexes\" our social identity. Discourse studies : How we use language to persuade / exert power relationships. Approaches to language structure \u00b6 Prescriptive grammars - how we SHOULD speak \u00b6 Prescriptive judgements regarding language usage are periodically proposed by influential individuals. Key targets of prescriptive judgements are the double negative and use of innit as a tage question. Linguists would not regard either of these forms as \"bad\" English. The key thing is that they are (a) shared among a speech community (b) adequately convey a message, i.e. do not lead to ambiguity and misunderstanding. (1) Double negative : I haven't got no money / I can't get no satisfaction Acceptable in certain dialects (e.g. London English) and languages (e.g. Spanish). It does not cause confusion as many prescriptivists claim. (2) Use of innit as a tag question It was a great meal, wasn't it / innit ? You're Jack's nephew, aren't you / innit ? They've been to Greece, haven't they / innit? This simplifies tag questions, but why is that a bad thing? Many languages create tag questions using single morphemes, e.g. Bengali kanna . (3) African-American Vernacular English : He be working Tuesdays (he is usually working on a Tuesday) He been got a job (he got a job a long time ago) It grammaticalises concepts which are not grammaticalised in Standard English. Therefore it is RICHER (with regard to certain grammatical subsystems). So how do prescriptive grammars arise? They reflect the dominant dialect in the country, which in turn is a consequence of which regions hold the most political and economic power. As Weinreich said 'A language is a dialect with an army and a navy' Descriptive grammars - how we ACTUALLY speak \u00b6 Geordie English: No plural suffix for nouns denoting a time period, e.g. I've been here three year. Scottish English: Use of amn't I ? as a tag question, e.g. I'm next in line, amn't I ? Mental grammars - the underlying system \u00b6 Which of these sentences is correct? Me and Jack went to the shops I and Jack went to the shops Jack and me went to the shops Jack and I went to the shops Now which is the way you actually say the sentence? Note that there is a conflict between prescriptive and mental grammars. Individuals who allow prescriptive grammars to override mental grammars are guilty of 'hypercorrection' Hypercorrection \u00b6 This is a phenomena whereby we override our mental grammar, and instead adopt a prescriptive grammar. Our natural tendency is to say Me and Jack went to the shops . This is our mental grammar . However, in certain formal contexts, we may say Jack and I went to the shops , which is often prescribed at school. Hypercorrection is interesting because it shows that prescriptive grammar has a lot of power over us. A communicative view of language \u00b6 Definition \u00b6 (1) Language is primarily a form a communication and all linguistic 'rules' subserve this goal (2) Linguistic 'rules' are established by speech communities (3) A sentence is 'well-formed' if it reliably expresses the speaker's thoughts using forms which are 'conventionalised', i.e. shared by the speaker's speech community. Relationship with SLT practice \u00b6 When assessing children we should evaluate their language according to the norms of their speech community For example, deviations from the target when scoring sentence repetition which are consistent with the speaker's dialect are not scored as an error. \"The Influence of Linguistic Bias Upon Speech-Language Pathologists\u2019 Attitudes Toward Clinical Scenarios Involving Nonstandard Dialects of English\", Easton and Verdon, 2020 Therapists were given dialect-related clinical scenarios, and needed to make clinical judgements Length of experience was correlated with more careful clinical judgements Positive attitudes to dialect difference were correlated with more careful clinical judgements. 5-minute exercise \u00b6 What is the grammatical word class (e.g. noun, verb, adjective etc.) of the italicised words in the following sentences: The raging river tore through the valley That film really sucks","title":"01 - Introduction"},{"location":"Linguistics%201%20lecture%20notes/01%20introduction/#01-introduction","text":"","title":"01 - Introduction"},{"location":"Linguistics%201%20lecture%20notes/01%20introduction/#introduction","text":"","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"Linguistics%201%20lecture%20notes/01%20introduction/#why-slts-need-to-know-about-linguistics","text":"Is a child who says Him go there language impaired?

Different dictionaries will list nighttime , night-time or night time . So conventions are fairly arbitrary. Something which are multiple words on a page, actually behave semantically like a single word e.g. He has a lot of joie de vivre Definition \u00b6 Working definition is 'Minimal Independent Symbolic Unit' (MISU) Minimal \u00b6 A \"minimal\" unit = we cannot split it into smaller pieces. Inactive -> * One sip of coffee and Charles changes from in- to hyper- active . It's unsplittable, and therefore a single word. Underconfident -> ?After eight pints, Angela changes from under- to over- confident . It's unsplittable, and therefore a single word. Walk out -> She walked through the door and out of my life. You can split it, and therefore it's two words. Blackbird (species) -> * She saw a black and a white bird in the tree. When we split the word, the sentence is grammatical, but note that black has lost its meaning to denote a species of bird. Therefore it is a single word. Black magic -> ?The witch practises both black and white magic A tricky one. It sounds just about okay, so best categorised as two words. But this is a judgement call. Independent \u00b6 This property can be defined in a couple of ways: (a) Words are interpretable in isolation. They may \"stand alone\". A: What was he doing? B: Working B: How would you describe the experience? B: Unbelievable Shark!!!!!!!! Swim!!!!!!!!! (b) Words can move around the sentence, e.g. The dog chased the cat The cat chased the dog He loves being with his dog Symbolic \u00b6 This means that there is an arbitrary relationship between form and function (or sound and meaning ) To test this, we can take a single concept, and look at words to describe this concept across languages. The words will have very different sound properties. The property of symbolism was listed by the linguist Charles Sanders Pierce (1839 - 194) as a key defining property of human languages A dirty secret - there is no adequate definition of a word \u00b6 All of the properties which are used to define a word: minimality, independence, and symbolism, are in fact gradable. For example black magic is weakly minimal as when the two units are separate it sounds ever so slightly odd, e.g. ?The witch practises both black and white magic Independence is also highly gradable. Both mood and tizz occur with similar meanings in the phrase, He is in a mood / tizz . But only mood can easily move around a sentence, e.g. His mood was dark . Moroever, if someone were to say tizz in isolation and ask you if it's a word you might find this difficult. You would probably say \"yes\" on the basis that it occurs in the phrase in a tizz but you would need to think carefully about this. Some types of word classes lack independence, e.g. determiners such as the . Finally, symbolism is also gradient. There is lots of interesting work demonstrating that sound symbolism is quite widespread in the world's languages. For example, across languages the word for `tongue' often contains /l/ (Blasi et al., 2016). So when in clinic you are analysing a sentence, and you're deciding to determine whether a lexical unit is a real word, there may not be a perfect yes/no answer! Word classes \u00b6 Words belong to word classes / syntactic categories The word class determines how we put words together to make sentences Semantic definitions - why the don't work very well \u00b6 Typical examples: A verb is a DOING word An adjective is a DESCRIBING word But are the following adjectives or verbs? The raging river tore through the valley That film really sucks These examples demonstrate that semantic/functional definitions of words fall short 3 ways to define word classes \u00b6 (a) Semantics / meaning-based test, e.g. a verb is a 'doing' word. (b) Morphological test, e.g. we can make a verb progressive by adding -ing (c) Positional test, e.g. verbs come after subjects and before objects, e.g. she ate the fish , she likes cheese . So which test? \u00b6 The positional test is the most reliable, e.g. The raging river tore through the valley: raging comes before a noun. It is an adjective That film really sucks : comes after the subject film . It is a verb. Let's meet the word classes! \u00b6 Categorization of word classes \u00b6 Content versus function words Content words = Nouns, Verbs, Adjectives, Adverbs (in Speech and Language Therapy, these are sometimes called 'information-carrying words') Function words = Determiners, Pronouns, Prepositions (and maybe certain types of verbs, we will come to this later) Open versus closed class. Open class words permit new members, while closed class words don't. NB all content words are open, and all function words are closed. Open = Nouns, Verbs, Adjectives, Adverbs Closed = Determiners, Pronouns, Prepositions. What the words do in the sentence? Referring words = Nouns, Pronouns Modifying words = Adjectives and Adverbs Where do they appear in the sentence? The verb complex tends to contain auxiliary verbs and adverbs in addition to the verb itself The Noun Phrase tends to contain determiners and adjectives in addition to the noun itself Prepositions are used before the Noun Phrase. Super- and sub-types Types of modifying words: adjectives and adverbs Types of referring words (nominals): Nouns and Pronouns Word classes and language impairment \u00b6 Children with language impairments Tend to miss out function words Have difficulties understanding prepositions (when used to express location), e.g. on , in Have reduced verb diversity Sometimes omit arguments of the verb, e.g. 'She put the books' 5 minutes exercise \u00b6 What's unusual about the following sentence: \"That film was absobloodylutely brilliant!\"?

There is activation across domains : semantic activation of multiple competitors, and phonological processes involved in blending (the use of a 'pivot'). The system biases speed over accuracy , but recovers from error due to a monitoring system . Meaning-related lexical relationships \u00b6 Hyponymy \u00b6 'Hypo' = under, 'nym' = word Plant > Tree > Sycamore / Plant > Flower > Daisy / Furniture > Chair > Stool Hyponymy can be characterised by superset/subset relationships. As you go upwards in the hierarchy the extension (i.e. the set of potential referents) expands. For example, there are more things in the set of plants (top of the hierarchy) than the set of trees (middle of the hierarchy). By contrast, as you go upwards in the hierarchy, the intension (list of definitional properties) narrows. For example, furniture = large practical object in the home. Chair = large practical object in the home + you sit on it. Stool = large practical object in the home + you sit on it + it has no backrest. Tree is a hyponym / subordinate of Plant Plant is a hyperonym / superordinate of Tree Mid-level categories are (a) more rapidly named, (b) more easily visualised, (c) acquired earlier Words which exist at the same level are called co-hyponyms or coordinates , e.g. daisy, begonia, Tulip / flower, bush, tree / chair, sofa, wardrobe. Synonmy \u00b6 'Syn' = together, 'nym' = name/word Words with identical meanings. Very few genuine synonyms. When words are identical in denotation (event or thing they refer to), they differ in connotation (set of associations they trigger), e.g. chap / bloke / geezer (who would you buy a used car from?) , fiesta / knees up / bash / soir\u00e9e (which would you prefer to go to?) There are very few genuine synonyms, i.e. where denotation and connotation are teh same. Some examples are words differing across dialects or varieties of a language, e.g. tap / fawcett, pavement / sidewalk , and some grammatical words, e.g. however / nonetheless Antonmy \u00b6 'Anto' = opposite, 'nym' = name/word Words with opposite meanings. Can be gradable (e.g. slightly hot , very cold ) or non-gradable (e.g. * very dead ) Sometimes there is no obvious opposite, e.g. the opposite of virgin . There is a 'lexical gap' Homonymy \u00b6 'Homo' = same, 'nym' = name/word. Same form, but no obvious meaning relationship. Words have similar forms due to ' historical accident '. May have same root (in which case there is a tenuous meaning relationship), e.g. a table of numbers, versus the kitchen table Or may have a different root, e.g. bay tree [LATIN baca], the ship entered the bay [OLD FRENCH baie], the dogs bayed [OLD FRENCH abai]. The fact that these words, with different an unrelated meanings, have the same pronunciation is a historical accident. Polysemy \u00b6 'Poly' = multiple, 'sem' = meaning. Same form, and different but related meanings. The meaning relationship is mentally represented Prepositions are notoriously polysemous, e.g. over = straight movement in contact with a plane, e.g. he ran over the field , or over = two dimensional movement across a bounded plane, e.g. the balloon floated over the city (or possibly there is no movement at all), or over = random movement covering a plane_, e.g. he poured ketchup over the chips_. Other polysemous words; He went to bed , a river- bed , flower bed , the steak was served on a bed of lettuce The cup was full , the room was full , she has a full schedule, she leads a full life. Are meaning relationships systematic or random? According to Charles Fillmore (e.g. Fillmore & Atkins, 2000), there is a central sense, with all meanings radiating from this central sense, e.g. all meanings of over share the idea that the 'figure' (smaller object) is, at some stage, above the 'ground' (larger object). All meanings of bed involve a flat surface made of a relatively soft material. When teaching a polysemous word, it may be best to start with the central meaning (or 'sense') of the word, and later teach the more peripheral meanings (e.g. Tyler & Evans, 2004) Homonyms versus Polysemes \u00b6 Both describe words with same form, but different meanings. The only difference is whether the meaning relationship is mentally represented . Moreover, according to Fillmore's approach meaning relationships among polysemous words are structure / systematic. The only way to test this is via personal intuition. Lexical gaps \u00b6 A language lacks a word where there should be one. Easily demonstrated with antonyms Opposite of bald? Opposite of virgin? Many English kinship terms are vague, e.g. English cousin can be used for a variety of different relations, while Sudanese has different words for every type of cousin. Loan words, e.g. kitsch & schadenfreude , are used to fill lexical gaps. A recent load word is hygge . Form-related relationships \u00b6 Homophony \u00b6 Same spoken form, different written forms (with different meanings) e.g. might / mite, leak / leek Homography \u00b6 Same written form, different spoken forms (with different meanings) e.g. bow, minute The strict definition of homonymy \u00b6 The definition we have learnt is: A word with the same form, but two different (but unrelated) meanings. When I refer to the same form, I am referring to the same spoken AND written form. However, there is a stricter version of homonyms, whereby the word can share EITHER the same spoken or written form. If you adopt this definition, then there is an overlap between homonyms, homophones and homographs. I have adopted the looser definition because (a) it is the most widely used definition, (b) if you adopt the narrow definition, the situation gets very confusing. If you really wish to see how all of the definitions intersect, then wikipedia has a very good page on this. Exploring semantic networks \u00b6 Word association norms \u00b6 A says a word, and B says the first word that comes into their heads Coordinates are the most frequent category, e.g. if the prime is cat , the participant says dog . Next are collocations (words which tend to co-occur, e.g. fish and chips , cats and dogs ). Then come superordinates, e.g. cat primes pet , and finally subordinates ( cat primes Siamese ). Word association tasks conducted with children with Developmental Language Impairments find tentative evidence for reduced semantic networks, e.g. large number of responses which are very odd, e.g. Spoon -> Disney, or based on phonological similarity, e.g. cow -> how (Sheng & McGregor, 2010) Semantic fluency tasks \u00b6 A asks B to say as many words as possible from a single category, e.g. animals, things you take on holidays. When asked to list animals, a typical response might be Dog, cat, rabbit -- lion, tiger -- fish, whale, dolphin Responses tend to be grouped into clusters, e.g. the above response contains a DOMESTIC ANIMAL cluster, then a WILD ANIMAL cluster, then a SEA MAMMAL cluster. Poorer semantic fluency in developmental language disorders and autism (Kail & Leonard, 1986; Bishop & Norbury, 2005). For example, they produce fewer words and clusters Some have suggested that semantic fluency tasks can be used to predict onset of Alzheimmers: few clusters, cluster members and switches between clusters (Gomez & White, 2006) Lexical priming tasks \u00b6 Does hearing word X spead up recognition / recall of word Y? Exploring word production using lexcial speech errors \u00b6 Types of error: Blend, e.g. lection Phonological substitution (malapropism), e.g. The Chinese emperor had many concubines -> porcupines, Brexit means Brexit -> breakfast (there are amusing clips of politicians and newsreaders accidentally calling Brexit \"breakfast\". Have a look for these you YouTube. Semantic substitution, e.g. Give me the hammer -> screwdriver. Tip of the tongue effects = we know the meaning of the word we want, but phonological access is partial Available evidence suggests 2-stage model: (1) Activation of meaning, (2) Activation of form. Phonological substitutions happen when the right meaning is activated, but the wrong form is chosen. Tip of the tongue effects are similar. We know the meaning, but in this case we can't activate the right form. In semantic substitution effects we accidentally choose the wrong meaning, and then select the form which corresponds to that meaning. The meaning level is called the \"lemma\" level, while the form level is called the \"lexeme\" level. 5-minute Exercise \u00b6 How many 'units of meaning' in the following words: Dogs Laughed Working Believe Unbelievable Sang Bibliography \u00b6 Kail, R., & Leonard, L.

WORD = minimal independent symbolic unit (or smallest standalone unit of meaning) \u00b6 Words can stand alone, e.g. A: What was he doing? B: Working B: How would you describe the experience? B: Unbelievable Shark!!!!!!!! Run!!!!!!!!! MORPHEME = minimal independent symbolic unit (or smallest standalone unit of meaning) \u00b6 i.e. like the definition of a word but we have removed the requirement to be independent / stand alone. How many 'units of meaning' in the following words: Dog-s = 2 morphemes Laugh-ed = 2 morphemes Work-ing = 2 morphemes Believe = 1 morpheme Un-believ-able = 3 morphemes Words versus morphemes \u00b6 The key thing to note is that there is an overlap in the definition of words and morphemes. Therefore some words are also morphemes! For example, dog is a word and a morpheme. We say that this is a morphologically simple word. However, words often contain more than one morpheme, e.g. dog-s . This is a morphologically complex word, i.e. a word consisting of more than one morpheme. Categorising morphemes \u00b6 Morphemes can be free or bound . If a morpheme is free it can also be classified as a word (because it can 'stand alone'). In the following sentence, we have examples of both free and bound closed-class morphemes Jack is (really) try- ing to run fast- er Bound morphemes can be prefixes or suffixes (which are both kinds of affixes ). Another type of bound morpheme is the infix , which comes in the middle of the word. English rarely uses infixes, and when they are used they sound \"marked\" (odd), e.g. fan- bloody -tastic). Other languages use infixes productively, e.g. Arabic Morphemes are divided into two categories, inflectional and derivational . While inflectional morphemes make minor modifications to a word's meaning, derivational morphemes are used to derive a new word, either by substantially changing meaning or altering word class. Words containing multiple morphemes are described as morphologically complex . The difference between inflectional and derivational morphemes \u00b6 (1) Inflectional morphemes are often affected by sentence position . For example, we use a special ending on the verb when the subject is 3rd person singular. We don't use that ending if the subject does not have these poperties, e.g. The cat hate-s the messy dog The cat-s hate the messy dog Derivational morphemes do not have this property. For example, the adjective messy contains the derivational morpheme -y, which turns the noun mess into an adjective. This process can happen when the noun dog occurs in any position in the sentence. (2) Inflectional morphemes are sensitive to phonetic context . The regular tense ending is pronouncd /t/ /d/ or /Id/ depending on the form of the \"root\", e.g. He dropp ed /t/ the book He turn ed /d/ the corner She skidd ed /Id/ on the mat (3) Inflectional morphemes are more productive than derivational morphemes. For example, we can add the regular past tense ending to any new verb which comes into the English language, e.g. she googled , they chillaxed . Derivational morphemes are more tied to words. For example, both un- , and in- mean THE OPPOSITE. But we use un- with educated , and in- with tolerant Uneducated Intolerant * Ineducated ??Untolerant * = very wrong, ?? = odd (4) inflectional morphemes can only come at the end of words , while derivational morphemes can come at the beginning and ends, e.g. laugh- ed Un -break- able Other differences between derivational and inflectional morphemes: (1) Derivational morphemes are longer (2) Derivational morphemes have more specific meanings, e.g. out in outmaneouvre means \"to do something better than a competitor\" (3) Derivational morphemes are more language-specific, e.g. out- prefix is not found in Spanish, and -ito/-illo diminutive suffixes are not used productively in English. Word-building processes \u00b6 There are three ways to form morphologically complex words using morphological processes Inflection (adding inflectional morphemes), e.g. laugh-ed Derivation (adding derivational morphemes), e.g. un-do Compounding (taking two words and \"squishing\" them together), e.g. fire man , book seller Generally the last two are described as word-building processes as they can be used to coin new words, e.g. skypeable , or red jacket man/woman (a mysterious handsome stranger you see on the Metro every morning) When we build morphologically-complex words, we tend follow a particular order We start out with the root (e.g. mention ) We add deriviational affixes (e.g. un-mention-able ) We add an inflectional affix (e.g. un-mention-able-s ) This gives the impression that we build up the words in a series of steps . Morphemes and language impairment \u00b6 Individuals with language impairment struggle with inflectional morphemes. In particular, children with Developmental Language Disorder (DLD) often miss out tense morphemes, e.g. regular past tense . For example, they might say I laugh at the joke instead of I laughed at the joke They also have difficulties making sure that the verb agrees with the subject, e.g. She always laugh at my jokes . The subject is third person singular, so the verb should be laugh-s Many studies quantify children's language abilities using the Mean Length of Utterance in Morphemes (total number of morphemes divided by the total number of utterances). Language-impaired individuals tend to have difficulties using derivational morphemes. It is worthwhile teaching these morphemes in clinic as they can be used to build words. Novel morphemes \u00b6 This is not essential knowledge for speech and language therapists, and is not an obligatory exam topic, but if you find linguistics intriguing and fun, you might wish to read on... Inflectional morphemes are generally viewed as a closed class. However, every now and then a new derivational morpheme comes along. A classic example is the -gate morpheme which is used to designate a government scandal, e.g. watergate , partygate , iraqgate , camillagate etc. Here are a couple more examples -core suffix as an cottage core. Its first usage was in the term hardcore to describe a material for road suracing . Core had a literal meaning to describe the material underneath the tarmac. Then it was used to describe very aggressive punk music, characterised by a very dedicated and fanatical fanbase. Then the term emocore came along. Emo refers to a genre of rock music which is associated with certain types of emotion, e.g. sadness, sensitivity and introspection , and the -core suffix took on the meaning of having a dedicated and fanatical fanbase. However, this is arguably ironic, as emocore fans were relatively passive compared to their punk counterparts. After this, -core became used as a general term to denote an artistic movement , first, mumblecore ( films from the early nineties following the lives of intelligent, arty and nihilistic twenty-year olds , and usually starring Greta Gerwig), and now cottagecore , i.e. genre of fashion characterised by wearing old-fashioned floral countrified clothes . The core example is interesting as it shows how a literal meaning (foundation for a road) turned into a figurative meaning (dedication to an artistic movement), which then morphed over time, and became gradually more ironic. - tifa morpheme. This comes from the word antifa used to describe anti-fascist protesters. During recent civil unrest in the US, partly in response to the George Floyd killing, the word grantifa was used to describe protesters who were elderly women.

For example, the adjective messy contains the derivational morpheme -y, which turns the noun mess into an adjective. This process can happen when the noun dog occurs in any position in the sentence. (2) Inflectional morphemes are sensitive to phonetic context . The regular tense ending is pronouncd /t/ /d/ or /Id/ depending on the form of the \"root\", e.g. He dropp ed /t/ the book He turn ed /d/ the corner She skidd ed /Id/ on the mat (3) Inflectional morphemes are more productive than derivational morphemes. For example, we can add the regular past tense ending to any new verb which comes into the English language, e.g. she googled , they chillaxed . Derivational morphemes are more tied to words. For example, both un- , and in- mean THE OPPOSITE.

Inflectional morphemes are generally viewed as a closed class. However, every now and then a new derivational morpheme comes along. A classic example is the -gate morpheme which is used to designate a government scandal, e.g. watergate , partygate , iraqgate , camillagate etc. Here are a couple more examples -core suffix as an cottage core. Its first usage was in the term hardcore to describe a material for road suracing . Core had a literal meaning to describe the material underneath the tarmac. Then it was used to describe very aggressive punk music, characterised by a very dedicated and fanatical fanbase. Then the term emocore came along. Emo refers to a genre of rock music which is associated with certain types of emotion, e.g. sadness, sensitivity and introspection , and the -core suffix took on the meaning of having a dedicated and fanatical fanbase. However, this is arguably ironic, as emocore fans were relatively passive compared to their punk counterparts. After this, -core became used as a general term to denote an artistic movement , first, mumblecore ( films from the early nineties following the lives of intelligent, arty and nihilistic twenty-year olds , and usually starring Greta Gerwig), and now cottagecore , i.e. genre of fashion characterised by wearing old-fashioned floral countrified clothes . The core example is interesting as it shows how a literal meaning (foundation for a road) turned into a figurative meaning (dedication to an artistic movement), which then morphed over time, and became gradually more ironic. - tifa morpheme.

What does the suffix 'mouth' mean? How do you pronounce it in each word? Portsmouth Plymouth Tynemouth Grangemouth Cockermouth Dual systems models of morphology \u00b6 These propose two systems involved in morphological storage / processing: A computational system Words are generated by taking a root and adding an affix (combinatoric symbolic rule) A lexical system Morphologically complex words are stored / processed as wholes in the lexicon Evidence for a computational system \u00b6 We can use morphemes productively He merengu ed his way onto the dance floor She was so angry that she crutch ed her boyfriend There are two wug s Look! The dog is meek ing The dog was un meek able Morphological movement, stranding and substitution errors indicate separate storage of inflectional / derivational morphemes She wash upp ed the dishes. We have a lot of church es in our minister She always pack s a keep Evidence that we process sounds which are potentially morphemes as morphemes ( morpho-phonological parsing - Post et al. 2008). For example reaction times indicate that we parse pseudo-inflections, e.g. mil d (potentially past tense of the verb to mile ) as actual inflections. This results in longer reaction times in a task where participants need to determine whether two words, e.g. mile and mild are the same or different. Words with regular inflectional affixes tend to be phonotactically irregular (e.g. irregular lost rhymes with frost , but regular turned does not rhyme with any other monomorphemic word). This suggests they are not stored, as phonotactic regularity is assumed to be a characteristic of the lexicon. Evidence of the whole-word storage of morphologically-complex words \u00b6 Some complex forms contain non-word roots , indicating that they haven't been built up compositionally, e.g. Un remitt ingly It's in evit able The food supplies were de plete d Some morphemes have multiple meanings, e.g. -er = AGENT, e.g. gardener , or INSTRUMENT, e.g. paint stripper . Specific roots bias the suffix towards one meaning or another, e.g. with gardener AGENT interpretation is much more likely than INSTRUMENT interpretation. Given this, it is likely that we access root + affix as a whole. If words were built up compositionally, how do we know which meaning of -er to select? Psycholinguistic evidence indicates that some morphologically-complex forms are stored as wholes, e.g. Loscewicz (1995) found that inflections in high-frequency inflected forms were significantly shorter than in low-frequency inflected forms. She therefore concluded that high-frequency forms were stored as a whole. Alegre and Gordon (1999) found a relationship between whole-word frequency and performance on a nonword discrimination task when whole-word frequency exceeded 1 per 7 million. Again, this suggests that high frequency morphologically complex forms may be stored as wholes. A hybrid view \u00b6 There is strong evidence for both computational and whole word accounts. Novel inflected forms, e.g. meek ed , must be generated by adding the morpheme. Words with non-word roots, e.g. unre mitt ingly clearly cannot be generated compositionally. So we have two possible** routes to creating morphologically-complex words. High frequency morphologically complex forms are stored in the lexicon Lower frequency forms are generated by computational processes This reflects a trade-off between speed of processing, and expressivity. Whole-word storage of morphologically complex forms reults in rapid processing. Rapid processing is particularly important when words are high frequency. For lower frequency forms, we store roots and affixes separately, and combine them. This explains how we are abloe to coin novel morphologically complex forms, e.g. meek ed **. Pronunciation of mouth in Plymouth versus Cockermouth may reflect two systems (high frequency form, stored as a whole, involves schwa sounds (neutral vowel) The binary view may be too simple. Aitchison (2002) suggests a variety of different levels of storage. For example, the semantic transparency of morphemes (how interpretable they are) exhibits gradient properties. Fogglemouth = This is an imaginary town lying at the mouth of the river 'Foggle'. Suffix -mouth is fully transparent. It is applied using a productive rule > Grangemouth = A real town, but for those outside the Cumbria, this is likely to be a low-frequency word. It may be stored as a whole. Suffix -mouth is less transparent than the -mouth in Fogglemouth > Plymouth = High frquency word stored as unanalysed whole. Suffix mouth is less transparent than in Grangemouth . chickenless (FULLY PRODUCTIVE / TRANSPARENT) > careless (PARTIALLY PRODUCTIVE / TRANSPARENT) > gormless, ruthless (NOT PRODUCTIVE / TRANSPARENT) For chickenless , both morphemes are semantically transparent. The word looks derived. For careless , the morphemes are transparent, but we are likely to store and process the word as a whole because it is high frequency. Finally, in gormless and ruthless the roots are not semantically transparent. Morphology in language impairments - Ullman and Pinker's Dual Route model \u00b6 Ullman and Pinker explain language difficulties in terms of the computational and lexical systems, and also give it a neuropsychological grounding. The computational system is governed by procedural memory (involved in the acquisition of unconscious, implicit routines), while the lexical system resides in declarative memory . In particular, they focus on verbs Irregular forms are stored as wholes in the lexicon Regular forms are generated via the computational system (NB Pinker and Ullman accept that high-frequency inflected forms may be stored in the lexicon) The two systems compete with each other under time pressure. If an irregular form is found, the computational process is blocked. If the irregular form is not found, the computational process takes over. Evidence: Frequency effects are only found in the irregular system only Children's overregularisation errors, e.g. she swammed are determined by the density of the irregular neighbourhood which the irregular root belongs to. Adult generation of inflected form is affected by input frequency only in the irregular system. Difficulties with regular forms are linked to impaired procedural memory: Children with Developmental Language Disorder Adults with Parkinsons Adults with Broca's-type aphasia Difficulties with irregular forms are linked to impaired declarative memory Adults with Anomia Adults with Wernicke's type aphasia Criticism of the dual route model \u00b6 (1) Pseudo-regularity (irregular forms exhibit characteristics of regular forms) \u00b6 Irregulars exhibit characteristics of the regular system, e.g. verbs already ending in an alveolar plosive are more likely to be irregular, e.g. meet -> met, let -> let, put -> put, shut -> meet -> met , and nouns already ending in -s are more likely to take irregular plurals, e.g. goose -> geese, mouse -> mice, moose -> moose . This has led some researchers to argue that there are not two completely separate systems for regular and irregular forms, e.g. Joanisse and Seidenberg (1999) (2) The role of frequency \u00b6 The Dual Route model argues that frequency effects are characteristic of the lexical/declarative system, but not the computational system. Nonetheless, frequency effects also characterise the regular system (e.g. Losiewicz and Alegre & Gordon studies cited above) 5-minute exercise \u00b6 Which one of these sentences did Yoda say in the Star Wars trilogy?

[ The cute green alien NOUN PHRASE ] (b) Where did Elliot find ET? [ In the toolshed PREPOSITIONAL PHRASE ] (c) What is Elliot doing? [Hugging the cute green alien VERB PHRASE ] Standalone test When questioned, the phrase can stand alone as an answer (see above) Coordination test Phrases may be coordinated, i.e. they may be produced in a series linked by a coordinator ( and , but , or ) e.g. (a) [Elliot and Gertie NOUN PHRASE ] loved [the cute green alien and the soft brown Teddy NOUN PHRASE ] (b) Elliot [hugged the cute green alien and cuddled the soft brown Teddy VERB PHRASE ] Movement test Phrases may, under circumstances move. If we attempt to move a group of words which is not a phrase, the sentence sound ungrammatical. Yoda (above) speak provides plenty of examples of the movement test, e.g. (a) [Mourn them] do not _ . (Movement of Verb Phrase) (b) [Consume you] it will _ . (Movement of Verb Phrase) (c) [The dark side] I sense _ in you. (Movement of Noun Phrase) (d) [Forever] it will dominate your destiny _ (Movement of Adverb Phrase. NB phrases can be single words. We can turn this into a multi-word phrase: For the rest of time.... ) Omission test Some phrases may be omitted. If a group of words may be omitted, it is likely to be a phrase, e.g. The man (in the moon) came down (too soon) (omission of prepositional phrase, and adverb phrase). This test is probably the weakest test, as not all phrases may be omitted. Filler test Fillers are words which we use to 'fill in' pauses. We tend to use them to 'cover up' disfluences. A classic example is 'like'. In general, fillers cannot be inserted within phrases, e.g. Elliot, like , loved the cute green alien ( like inserted between phrases - sounds okay) ? Elliot loved the, like , cute green alien ( like inserted within the Noun Phrase - sounds odd.) To remember these tests learn the following acronym: Really Quick Snakes Can Make Orangutans Flee Semantic tests for phrasehood \u00b6 The phrase is about a single thing. That thing is expressed by the 'head' of the phrase.

[Mourn them VERB PHRASE ] do not _ . [Miss them VERB PHRASE ] do not _ . Attachment leads to Jealousy. Notice that auxiliary verbs (and negative particles) are not part of the Noun Phrase ( [Mourn them VERB PHRASE ] do not, [Eaten them VERB PHRASE ] she has _ ).

PRESENT TENSE: At the moment of speaking, the speaker likes cheese. She ate an apple. PAST TENSE: The eating event occurred BEFORE the moment of speaking. English has two morphological tenses (i.e. marked by verb endings): the past and the present. The future is not morphologically marked, but is expressed in a variety of different ways. \"will\" future: I'll help you to carry that shopping. \"going to\" future: I think I'm going to be sick. \"about to\" future: I am about to be sick PRESENT TENSE as future: The train leaves at 6.15 PRESENT PROGRESSIVE as future: We're leaving at 10am. These forms for expressing the future are generally not described as tenses because They are not morphological forms (i.e. they involve more than verb endings) They express meanings above and beyond the future. For example.... \"will\" is used for OFFERS and PREDICTIONS e.g. I'll help you with that bag, I think it will rain tomorrow \"going to\" is used to talk about the FUTURE BASED ON CURRENT EVIDENCE, or PLANS e.g. I think I'm going to be sick (because I feel nauseous), I'm going to apply for a Speech and Language Therapy course PRESENT TENSE is used for a TIMETABLED FUTURE, e.g. e.g. The train leaves at 6.15 PRESENT PROGRESSIVE is used for a FUTURE ARRANGEMENT e.g. I'm studying Speech and Language Therapy next year (I already have a place on a course) \"be about to\" is for the NEAR FUTURE e.g. The players are warming up. The match is about to begin. Because future forms in English are not strictly tenses, we are going to refer to the \"future tense\" in inverted commas. Next week, we're going to be looking at the syntax/morphology of tense in more detail. Aspect \u00b6 Inherent temporal properties of events \u00b6 Zoetrope - a victorian parlour toy designed to create a moving image Which of the following verbs would make a good zoetrope? swim crash laugh dive pop dance exist For a verb to work in zoetrope it needs (a) 'internal structure' (b) no definite end point, e.g. running, walking, swimming. We can see that certain verbs have particular temporal properties. These properties are referred to as \"lexical aspect\" (sometimes called \"aktionsarten\") (a) States versus non-states \u00b6 States are abstract, and do not have \"internal structure\" (e.g. \"existing\" doesnt' vary in any way across time, while when you are running, different snapshots will show your arms and legs in completely different positions). Non-states have internal structure. Examples of states are \"existing verbs\", be, live, exist, \"experiencer-theme verbs\", e.g. like, love, hate , and mental state verbs, e.g. believe, know, hope . Tests... Because they are abstract they are difficult to define. E.g. you can give a good definition of run , but try to give a definition of exist , or like State verbs sound odd in the progressive (-ing form), e.g. ?? she is existing, ??she is liking the food, ??I am believing in fairies . This is becuase the progressive places us inside the event, and this is difficult to do when an event does not have a rich internal structure. They sound odd as reponses to the question what happened? , e.g. Q. What happened? ???A. She liked the food (b) Activities versus events \u00b6 Activities do not have a natural end point (they are \"atelic\"). Events have a natural end point (they are \"telic\"). Examples of activities are run, walk, wash, work . Examples of events are break, collapse, crash, fall Because activities do not have a natural endpoint, they sound good when used with time expressions which imply an incomplete activity e.g. I've been walking for an hour (and I may continue to walk for another hour). By contrast events sound odd when used with such time expressions, e.g * It collapsed for an hour. Events sound good with time expressions which imply a complete activity, e.g. The bridge collapsed in five seconds . Activities do not sound good with such time expressions, e.g. * He walked in five minutes (c) Accomplishments versus achievements \u00b6 Achievements are instantaneous events, taking place in a very brief instant, while accomplishments can take place over an extended period of time. The linguistic term to descibe this phenomenon is \"durative\" (see table below). A durative event is one which is extended in time. Because Achievements are instantaneous / non-durative, they cannot be stopped in the middle, e.g. ? They stopped reaching the summit ? The balloon stopped popping This contrasts with Accomplishments which can be stopped in the middle, eg. She stopped jumping over the stairs They stopped building the house In addition, because Accomplishments are extended in time, we can use them with progressive grammatical aspect, while we cannot do this with Acheivements, e.g. They are building the house ? They are reaching the summit Dynamic (Rich internal structure) Durative (Occurs during prolonged period) Telic (Bounded) State - + - Activity + + - Accomplishment + + + Achievement - - + Summary of tests \u00b6 Definition test: States are relatively hard to define. What happened test: Doesn't sound good with States Present progressive (-ing form): States and Achievements do not sound good in the progressive \"for\" test: Activities sound good with a \"for\" expression, but not events. \"in\" test: Events sound good with \"in\" but not activities \"Stop\" test: Achievements do not sound good with \"stop\", e.g. she stopped reaching the top of the mountain Multiple lexical aspects \u00b6 Some verbs seem to have more than one lexical aspect I like cheese (STATE) She liked my post on facebook (i.e. pressed \"like\") (ACHIEVEMENT) I have a car (STATE) She's having a good time (ACTIVITY) I love that dress (STATE) I'm loving this book (ACTIVITY???) Be quiet. I'm thinking (ACTIVITY) I think you're really rude (STATE) So what's going on here? One possibility is that each verb has two different meanings corresponding to different lexical aspects. This is certainly the case for think ( thinking as an activity versus think =believe). With other verbs it's possibly to identify a primary meaning, and a secondary meaning which is an extension of the primary meaning, e.g. love = STATE -> loving = ACTIVITY. Some verbs can `shift' lexical aspect depending on sentence context; She's is dancing (ACTIVITY) She finally danced the tango (ACHIEVEMENT) The light is flashing (ACTIVITY, NB there is an `iterative' interpretation) The light flashed (ACHIEVEMENT) However, it is often possible to identify a `core', most frequently used lexical aspect. Exercise \u00b6 What is the lexical aspect of the following verbs? fly sing flatten paint cover suck flash Grammatical aspect \u00b6 Grammatical aspect refers to grammatical devices to signal one's perpsective on an event . In English there are two grammatical aspects: PROGRESSIVE and PERFECTIVE. The progressive (-ing form), signals an INTERNAL perspective on the event, while the perfective (-en form) signals an EXTERNAL perspective on the event, He is danc ing (PROGRESSIVE aspect) She is sing ing (PROGRESSIVE aspect) We are \"inside\" the event in the sense that the event continues up till the time of speaking, and will continue after the time of speaking. King Kong has fall en (PERFECTIVE aspect) I have brok en the chair (PERFECTIVE aspect) We are \"outside\" the event in the sense that the event is complete. Other languages have richer systems, e.g Spanish differentiates between the Imperfective and the Progressive. Tense is not aspect \u00b6 Students often confuse tense and aspect. Don't worry, this is normal, as these concepts are very closely related. Here are two sentences which demostrate the difference: By this time next week, I will have eaten all of the tins of baked beans in my cupboard This sentence uses the \"WILL\" FUTURE, but perfective aspect to express COMPLETION She was sleeping when the earthquake happened This sentence is in the PAST TENSE but uses progressive aspect to describe an ONGOING event. Combinations of tense, grammatical and lexical aspect \u00b6 \"Alignment\" \u00b6 Certain lexical and grammatical aspects \"align\", i.e. a verb with a certain lexical aspect is more likely to be used with a particular grammatical aspect. For example, I=if a verb has no natural end point (e.g. an activity verb), we are more likely to use it with progressive grammatical aspect, e.g. the horse is running . If a verb has a natural endpoint (e.g. an accomplishment or achievement verb) we are more likely to use it with perfective aspect, e.g. he has just jumped off the roof , she has reached the top of the mountain . In addition there is \"alignment\" between lexical aspect and tense. For example, if a verb has a natural endpoint (accomplishment / achievement verb) it is more likely to be used with past tense, which also implies completion, e.g. she jumped off the wall, the lightbulb flashed. \"Weird and wonderful\" combinations of tense and aspect \u00b6 Tense, grammatical and lexical aspect combine in weird and wonderful ways. This is a very complex system and we can only begin to scrape the surface. (a) Present tense and Activity/Accomplishment/Achievement verbs \u00b6 When present tense is used with Activities, Accomplishments and Achievements, we get a HABITUAL intepretation, e.g. She sings every day. He works in a call centre He smashes things (he's clumsy or aggressive) (b) Progressive grammatical aspect and achievement verbs \u00b6 This conveys an iterative interpretation (repeated events) The light is flashing He's flattening boxes Tense/aspect and SLT practice \u00b6 Children with SLI have difficulties marking tense, e.g. He went there -> Him go there However, this is a difficulty with the morphological expression of tense, rather than a difficulty understanding what tense means. Young children, when acquiring tense, conflate tense and aspect . They are more likely to mark paste tense on Achievement and Accomplishment verbs, because these tend to describe COMPLETED events. This is sometimes referred to as \"the aspect hypothesis\". Some studies have argued that by manipulating the lexical aspect of verbs you can help children acquire tense (Van Horne et al., 2017; Johson & Morris, 2007). In fact, Van Horne et al. found that children with DLD were better at producing the past tense forms when trained on more difficult items , i.e. those where there is a mismatch between tense and aspect. For example hum is an activity verb, so tends to be used with progressive grammatical aspect ( she is humming ) and is rarely produced in the past tense (e.g. she hummed ). Elicit mismatch verbs such as hummed seems to help children to learn to produce the past tense. Some studies have found that language-impaired children have difficulties comprehending and producing grammatical aspect (Fletcher et al. 2005; Leonard et al. 2007) Homework \u00b6 What is unusual about the following sentence? \"Here be dragons\" Bibliography \u00b6 Fletcher, P., Leonard, L.

King Kong has fall en (PERFECTIVE aspect) I have brok en the chair (PERFECTIVE aspect) We are \"outside\" the event in the sense that the event is complete.

Young children, when acquiring tense, conflate tense and aspect . They are more likely to mark paste tense on Achievement and Accomplishment verbs, because these tend to describe COMPLETED events. This is sometimes referred to as \"the aspect hypothesis\". Some studies have argued that by manipulating the lexical aspect of verbs you can help children acquire tense (Van Horne et al., 2017; Johson & Morris, 2007). In fact, Van Horne et al. found that children with DLD were better at producing the past tense forms when trained on more difficult items , i.e. those where there is a mismatch between tense and aspect. For example hum is an activity verb, so tends to be used with progressive grammatical aspect ( she is humming ) and is rarely produced in the past tense (e.g. she hummed ). Elicit mismatch verbs such as hummed seems to help children to learn to produce the past tense.

Bikavit gugo tunglish How did you complete the artificial language learning task? You figured out that particular positions in the sentences had particular FUNCTIONS. e.g. Subject, Verb, Object. Functions and sentence position \u00b6 Obligatory functions - Subjects and Verbs \u00b6 Almost all sentences of English needs a Subject and a Verb [ Syntax $ {SUBJECT}$ ] rocks! $ {VERB}$ [ Madonna $ {SUBJECT}$ ] sings $ {VERB}$ [ That donkey $ {SUBJECT}$ ] kicks! $ {VERB}$ The Subject is often the do-er, e.g. Madonna is the person who sings, and the donkey is the thing that kicks. However, in the following sentence Breakfast is served Breakfast is not the do-er. This shows that functions express a relationship which is only loosely linked to meaning . Functions express syntactic relationships , and are more closely related to sentence position than meaning. For example, in English, the Noun Phrase which comes immediately before the verb is always the Subject. In many languages the formal relationship between subject and verb is expressed via agreement . This means that the form of the verb is linked to the type of subject, e.g. Person Singular Plural 1st (speaker) I sing We sing 2nd (addressee) You sing You sing 3rd (person outside the conversation) She sing-s They sing We can see that the English paradigm is very sparse. However, other languages have much richer verb agreement paradigms, e.g. Spanish and Latin. Functions which are \"chosen\" by the verb \u00b6 (a) Objects \u00b6 After the verb, we often (but not always) have an Object Syntax rocks [ my world! $_{OBJECT}$ ] Madonna sings [ catchy tunes $_{OBJECT}$ ] That donkey kicks [ people $_{OBJECT}$ ] These are \"chosen\" by the verb in the sense that only certain verbs can take objects. For example, after the verbs yawn and run we typically do not have objects, e.g. He yawned She ran These are called intransitive verbs. Some verbs take two objects, in which case we have a direct and an indirect object . Direct Object (Od in LARSP) Indirect Object (Oi in LARSP) Meaning The thing which changes location / possession, e.g. She gave the ball to Jack The thing which receives the transferred entity, e.g. She gave the ball to Jack ** Animacy Often inanimate Often animate Syntax Does not come after a preposition Often comes after a preposition Note that the Indirect Object is \"parasitic\" on the Direct Object in the sense that it needs a Direct Object in order to be realised; Janet gave [ a book $_{Direct~Object}$] Janet gave [ a book $ {Direct~Object}$]. [ to Mary $ {Indirect~Object}$ ] ?? Janet gave [ to Mary $_{Indirect~Object}$ ] For the following sentences, which are the direct and indirect objects? Albert showed Victoria his stamp collection Ennis brought a book for Angie Could you rustle me up an omellete? Patricia sent her friend a letter NB sometimes there is more than one option to realise direct versus indirect objects: Abdul sent Josh a letter (called the \"Double Object Dative\") Abdul sent a letter to Josh (called the \"Prepositional Dative\") Od and Oi are \"chosen\" by the verb, in the sense that there are particular verbs which tend to take two objects. Groups of verbs taking two objects are verbs of physical transfer ( give, take, receive, lend, borrow, deliver, donate, show ) and verbs of metaphorical transfer ( tell, explain ) (b) Subject and Object complements \u00b6 Subject Complements (Cs) are phrases which describe a property of the subject , while Object Complements (Co) describe a property of the object . Here are some examples: Jack is [ terrible at maths ] = Cs describing Subject Jack Ali appears [ troubled ] at the moment = Cs describing Subject Ali I consider him [ my best friend ] = Co describing Object him I want that bedroom [ cleaned ] by tomorrow = Co describing Object bedroom Genevieve painted her bedroom walls [ dark green ] = Co describing Object her bedroom walls The mechanic hammered the panel [ flat ] = Co describing Object the panel Note that while Subjects and Objects are realised as Noun Phrases, Subject and Object Complements can be realised in many ways, e.g. as Adjective Phrases (e.g. terrible at maths ), or as Prepositional Phrases, e.g. he ripped the paper [ into pieces ] . Here is a list of verbs which tend to take complements Verbs which can take subject complements The copula - is/are/was/were Verbs of appearance - seem, appear, look, e.g. she seems / looks / appears tired Verbs of perception - *feel, smell, sound, taste, e.g. the food smells / tastes funny Verbs of persistence - stay, remain, e.g. You must stay / remain calm Verbs which can take object complements : appoint, call, certify, consider, crown, declare, elect, find, hold, imagine, keep, like, make, name, prefer, proclaim, profess, pronounce, prove, report, send, think, turn Complements are less moveable than objects. For example, in (1) and (2) below, we can move the objects to the front of the sentence. But this is not the case for complements (3) and (4) Jack gave Peter the book -> The book was given to Peter by Jack Jack gave Peter the book -> Peter was given the book by Jack Jack resembles Paul -> * Paul is resembled by Jack Magda named her daughter Isobel -> * Isobel was named her daughter by Magda NB these types of sentences are all examples of \"the passive\" which will be covered next semester Optional modifying functions \u00b6 Post-modifiers and Adverbials \u00b6 In many cases, the verb determines the functions which we can use, e.g. sit cannot be used with an Object Noun Phrase. Jack sat $*$ Jack sat [ the chair $_{OBJECT NOUN PHRASE}$] All of the above functions are, more-or-less, \"chosen\" by the verb. However, there are two functions which are not \"chosen\" by the verb: Adverbial and Postmodifier. An adverbial is a phrase (consisting of either a single word, or a group of words) which (a) modifies the verb or the sentence, and (b) occupies a \"peripheral\" position in the sentence, i.e. at the very beginning or the very end, and (c) can occur in EITHER peripheral position (i.e. it can be placed either at the beginning or end) [ On Tuesday ] we should have a picnic [ in my opinion ] [ With a bit of luck ] we will have good weather [ from tomorrow ] Though luckily in the following sentence has precisely the same function as the Adverbial with a bit of luck it is not peripheral, and therefore we are not categorising it as an adverbial. It is a adverb coming inside the Verb Complex. We [ luckily had $_{VERB~COMPLEX}$] good weather While Adverbials modify the verb, or sentence, Postmodifiers modify the Noun. They come after the noun, e.g. The man [ with the red hat ] followed me down the street The dog [ that scratched me ] was a Border Collie Functions and morphology \u00b6 Case-marking \u00b6 The syntactic function of a word or phrase may impact on its morphology. This phenomenon is called case-marking . A word whose morphology demonstrates its syntactic function is said to be case-marked . In English, case-marking only applies to Pronouns: Subject form (called NOMINATIVE or SUBJECTIVE case) = I, you, he/she/it, we, you, they Od, Oi, Cs, Co form (called ACCUSATIVE or OBJECTIVE form) = Me, you, him/her/it, us, you. them We also apply the GENITIVE CASE (denoting possession) to Nouns, e.g. She scratched Anna's car. Other language have much richer case systems, e.g. with special forms for direct versus indirect objects, and the possibility of marking case on Nouns as well as pronouns. Functions and language impairments \u00b6 Language-impaired children \u00b6 Language-impaired children occasionally omit subjects. This is a pattern found in younger typically-development children (Grela 1997, 2003) (He) went there. They also have case-marking difficulties in subject position, often using the accusative case, instead, e.g. Him go there. They also fail to inflect the verb which results in a loss of Subject-Verb agreement (as shown above, correct form of the verb is goes ) LARSP framework \u00b6 This is a framework for assessing child language taught in Linguistics II. It is designed to determine the child's syntactic level. To perform a LARSP analysis, you must determine the complexity of syntactic functions, e.g. She likes it = Simple one-word subject and object The girl likes the boy = Two-word subject and object containing Determiner + Noun combination. 5 minute exercise \u00b6 What is wrong with the following sentences?

An adverbial is a phrase (consisting of either a single word, or a group of words) which (a) modifies the verb or the sentence, and (b) occupies a \"peripheral\" position in the sentence, i.e. at the very beginning or the very end, and (c) can occur in EITHER peripheral position (i.e. it can be placed either at the beginning or end) [ On Tuesday ] we should have a picnic [ in my opinion ] [ With a bit of luck ] we will have good weather [ from tomorrow ] Though luckily in the following sentence has precisely the same function as the Adverbial with a bit of luck it is not peripheral, and therefore we are not categorising it as an adverbial. It is a adverb coming inside the Verb Complex. We [ luckily had $_{VERB~COMPLEX}$] good weather While Adverbials modify the verb, or sentence, Postmodifiers modify the Noun. They come after the noun, e.g. The man [ with the red hat ] followed me down the street The dog [ that scratched me ] was a Border Collie","title":"Post-modifiers and Adverbials"},{"location":"Linguistics%201%20lecture%20notes/09%20Syntactic%20Functions/#functions-and-morphology","text":"","title":"Functions and morphology"},{"location":"Linguistics%201%20lecture%20notes/09%20Syntactic%20Functions/#case-marking","text":"The syntactic function of a word or phrase may impact on its morphology.

Always should be someone you really love. Apart from the main cause (\"We're looking for Girls\", \"Always should be someone\"), this has 6 dependent clauses with finite verbs: ...who are boys Who like boys to be girls Who do boys like they're girls Who do girls like they're boys. \u2026you really love We're going to be looking at these different types of clauses. Clinical relevance \u00b6 Language impaired individuals have particular difficulties comprehending and producing \"complex\" sentences Complex sentences are particularly important in educational and workplace settings. Other types of dependent clause \u00b6 Last week, we looked at adverbial clauses, these come inside an adverbial: [ When [ I fall in love ADVERBIAL.CLAUSE $]$ ADVERBIAL ] it will be forever Dependent clauses can come inside any other syntactic function (except the Verb Complex): S, Od, Oi, Cs, Co, and Pmod Dependent clauses as a complement of the verb (Od, Oi, Cs, Co) \u00b6 Od and Oi position \u00b6 Dependent clauses in Direct Object position Last night I dreamt [ (that) somebody loved me Od ] (the Smiths) I'll tell $[$ you Oi ] [ what I want Od ] (Spice Girls) I told [ you Oi ] [ I was ill Od ] (Spike Milligan's Epitaph) It may be easier to see that it is a Direct Object if you substitute it for the word \"something\" (the SOMETHING TEST!!) Last night I dreamt SOMETHING \u2192 somebody loved me. I told you SOMETHING \u2192 I was ill. I'll tell you SOMETHING \u2192 What I want. Cs and Co position \u00b6 Clauses can also come as Subject or Object Complement Money, that's [ what I want Cs ] (Barrett Strong - Old Motown Hit) I'll name [ this ship Od ] [ whatever I want Co ] (King Charles - (hungover)) Again, we can substitute the phrase with SOMETHING: Money, that's SOMETHING I'll name this ship SOMETHING Dependent clauses in Subject Position \u00b6 Here is an example of a dependent clause in subject position [ That she passed the exam S ] surprised her teacher. However, it sounds a bit weird. It would be much more natural to say to move the long Subject to the end and replace it with a dummy/expletive \"it\": It surprised her teacher [ that she passed the exam ] Why does this happen? In English we do not like very long phrases ar the beginning of a sentence. Here is another example I feel _ about weddings [ the way cats feel about waterslides ] (Nell Frizelle, Guardian) The phrase \"the way cats feel about waterslides\" has moved from its initial position (shown by the underscore): I feel [ the way cats feel about waterslides ] about weddings. But this just doesn't work!! Some researchers have suggested that there is a cross-linguistic tendency to shift long phrases to the end of a sentence to \"save the difficult things till last\". However, some languages seem to like long phrases at the front (Japanese). Dependent clauses in Post-modifer Position \u00b6 A postmodifier is a phrase which comes after a noun and modifies it. I found the book [ under the sofa ] I saw a man [ with the wooden leg ] Clauses can also come in postmodifier position She never gave me a reason [ why she arrived late ] I didn't believe Giles' claim [ that Geoff ate the chocolate cake ] I found the book [ that was under the sofa ] I saw a man [ who had a wooden leg ] The final two examples are \"relative\" clauses. Focus on relative clauses \u00b6 Girls who are boys... \u00b6 This is the type of clause that appears in the chorus of Girls and Boys: (We're) Looking for Girls who are boys Who like boys to be girls Who do boys like they're girls Who do girls like they're boys . Always should be someone you really love. The restrictive / non-restrictive distinction \u00b6 These are \"restrictive\" relative clauses. They take a set of entities, and restrict them to those entities with a specific property. e.g. \"girls who are boys\" is a subset of \"girls\". We can also use non-restrictive relative clauses, which just provide extra information. The Paris which is in Texas is warmer than the Paris which is in France (restrictive relative clauses) Paris, which is the capital of France , is a lovely city (non-restrictive relative clauses) Properties of relative clauses \u00b6 (a) Summary of properties Relative clauses have a number of interesting properties. They are headed by a relative pronoun (who, that, which). The can contain unusual word orders (e.g. There's the cat$ {OBJ}$ I$ {SUB}$ saw$_{VERB}$ ) They can split Subjects from Verbs (b) The relative pronoun The word which introduces the relative clause ( that, which, who ) is best described as a Pronoun. Why? She likes her : Pronouns are marked for CASE. She likes it : Pronouns are marked for ANIMACY DISTINCTION Now let's look at case-marking in relative pronouns: There's the man who saw him There's the man whom he saw And the animacy distinction There's the man who I saw. I found the money that I dropped. Occasionally the relative pronoun can be omitted: I found the money (that) I dropped The rules for this are slightly complicated. We can imagine the relative pronoun as \"moving\" to the front of the relative clause: He saw him -> There's the man whom he saw. (c) Unusual word orders When the relative pronoun refers to the OBJECT, we have an unusual (OSV) word order: There's the man who Obj. I Subj. saw V There's the fish that that Obj. she Subj. ate V (d) Splitting subjects from verbs If relative clauses come in the middle of sentences they can split Subjects from Verbs The man [ who I saw ] was happy This makes sentences with centre-embedded relative clauses particularly hard to process. Relative clauses in research \u00b6 Relative clauses are very widely used in linguistic research because: They vary in interesting ways across languages In some languages they allow you create simple and complex versions of the same sentence WITHOUT MAKING ANY CHANGES TO THE WORDS IN THE SENTENCE e.g. There's the cat that chased the dog / There's the dog that the cat chased This is incredibly useful because we can control for lexical factors and sentence length, while focusing on syntactic complexity. They are very sensitive to overall linguistic ability. Language impaired individuals find relative clauses particularly difficult to process.","title":"14 - Other types of dependent clause"},{"location":"Linguistics%201%20lecture%20notes/16%20Other%20types%20of%20dependent%20clauses/#14-other-types-of-dependent-clause","text":"","title":"14 - Other types of dependent clause"},{"location":"Linguistics%201%20lecture%20notes/16%20Other%20types%20of%20dependent%20clauses/#homework","text":"(We're) Looking for Girls who are boys Who like boys to be girls Who do boys like they're girls Who do girls like they're boys.

Like (2) it is complex in terms of its ordering, in this case the ordering of thematic roles / relations. We have seen that complex syntactic constructions occur in language assessment materials, and are therefore good items for diagnosing language difficulties. But does complex syntax bear any relation to real life communication? In which contexts does complex syntax occur? \u00b6 Complex syntax in school texts \u00b6 Have a look at these real passages from school text books (source: presentation by Marilyn Nippold at the RCLST) \"Botanists claim that [ some wildflowers, such as blazing stars, grow well in grasslands Clause in Od position ]\" Also the subject wildflowers is separated from the verb grow \"Most grasslands are populated by large herds of grazing animals, such as bison, [ a species of mammal native to the American prairies... ?? reduced relative clause * ] Millions of bison, commonly known as buffalo , once ranged over the American prairie, [ where they were preyed upon by wolves, coyotes, and humans Relative clause ]\" (Biggs et al., 2002, p. 83) Passives underlined . Phrases which separate subjects from verbs are shown in highlights . Dependent clauses are shown in brackets. * This doesn't look like a clause as it does not contain a verb. But you could rephrase it as ... bison, which are a species of mammal... \"Other important prairie animals include prairie dogs, [ which are seed-eating rodents [ that build underground \"towns\" [ known to stretch across mile after mile of grassland 3 relative clauses nested inside each other! ] ] ], and the foxes and ferrets [ that prey on them relative clause ].\" (Biggs et al, 2002, p. 83) Complex syntax in the workplace \u00b6 Complex texts are found in any job which involves understanding complex systems (Rose, 1989) Complex syntax and expository discourse \u00b6 Our language gets more complex when we start to talk about complex things, e.g. the rules of a game of football are more complex than the rules of a running race. A discourse in which we describe a complex body of knowledge is called an `expository' discourse (exposition = explanation). This can be compared with a `narrative' discourse (telling a story) Good prompts for expository discourse Tell me the rules of your favourite sport or game How would you solve a particular conflict between peers? (Nippold et al. 2007) Tell me what you learnt in school today. An expository discourse example \u00b6 Data taken from Nippold (2008) Here are individuals describing their favourite team game. What kind of complex structures are being used? You just try to get a team. It doesn't matter how many you need. You just got like six. Play three on three or something like that. And just get a football or something like a cup or something. And just play. Make a field and stuff. Lots of short sentences with no dependent clause. This is from a child who is either young or has language difficulgies So [ if the line gets past the offensive line Adverbial clause ], the offensive line on the other hand can't just grab people [ and throw them out of their way Conjoined clause ]. They have to push them. They can't just pick them up [ and throw them out Conjoined clause ] [ because then they will be called for holding Adverbial clause ], [ which is an illegal move Relative clause ]. And you'll get penalized 5 yards for that. Multiple dependent clauses Expository Discourse and Language Impairment \u00b6 Language-impaired children eventually overcome grammatical errors, e.g. omission of verb endings. But they find Expository Discourse very difficult in later childhood, due to difficulties with complex syntax. Given importance of Expository Discourse, this will impact on their life opportunities. Though expository discourse is difficult for language-impaired children, eliciting expository discourse does in fact lead to greater clausal complexity. This suggests that it might be beneficial to elicit expository discourse in clinical contexts. (But there is very little actual research on this) Take home message: When working on complex syntax with a client, consider the relationship between genre (e.g. expository versus conversational discourse) and complexity Can particular genres be used to elicit and treat complex structures? Ways to make complex structures easier \u00b6 Keeping subjects and verbs together \u00b6 The cow Sub [ that chased the girl ] was Verb big Botanists claim that some wildflowers Sub , $[$ such as blazing stars $]$, grow Verb well in grasslands. These sentences are relatively difficult as the subject is separated from the verb. (1) is especially difficult as (a) the Subject has a dual role, being the subject of both chase and be , and (b) it contains the string \"the girl was big\" which is confusing because it is the cow that is big. Removing tense from dependent clauses \u00b6 The dog (that was) chasing the cat was brown Removal of tensed verb was (plus that ) makes sentence eaiser to understand. The food (that is) eaten in Japan is absolutely delicious Removal of tensed verb is (plus that ) makes sentence easier to understand. Using pronouns inside dependent clauses \u00b6 (adapted from Gibson, 1998) The student who the professor who the scientist collaborated with had advised copied the article The student who the professor who he collaborated with had advised copied the article Use of pronoun he instead of Noun Phrase the scientist makes a massive difference to the interpretability of the sentence. An important study by Kidd et al. (see Bibliography) found that young children found relative clauses much easier to produce when they contain a pronoun rather than a full noun phrase, e.g. The dog that he chased was brown , rather than the dog that the man chased was brown . Making situations irreversible \u00b6 A cow chasing a horse is a reversible situation, because you can swap the arguments around (e.g. a horse chasing a cow) and the situation will still be plausible. Complex sentences with reversible situations are easier to comprehend. The cat that the dog chased was brown Quite hard to understand because the situation is reversible The cheese that the mouse nibbled was mouldy Easier to understand because the situation is not reversible Putting it all together! \u00b6 There are many ways to manipulate complex sentences in clinic to make them easier / more difficult. But how do you use this in treatment? Do you start with complex structures? Do you start with simple structures and make them complex? There is little research on this, and opinions vary. A recent paper by van Horne argues that deliberately exposing children to complex input led to better learning (though she was looking at past tense morphology, rather than complex syntax) Bibliography \u00b6 Kidd, E., Brandt, S., Lieven, E., & Tomasello, M.

When we speak, our thoughts are straightforwardly converted to linguistic symbols, which are encoded in the speech signal. The hearer decodes this signal to arrive at the speaker's thoughts. Animals are capable of using code-like communication systems, e.g. the waggle dance which bees use. This encodes the direction of the source of pollen (direction bee is pointing), and also the distance of the hive (time spent waggling). Is language a code? \u00b6 It is tempting to view language as a code-like system, and in many ways it is code-like. But in other ways it is completely different, e.g. A: Did you like the meal at the restaurant? B: The starters were good. B would infer that the rest of the meal was not good. This message is not explicitly encoded in the speech signal. So language does not operate like a code. We often use inference to derive the meaning of the utterance. Inference is a type of informed guesswork , which we can use to derive meanings which are not explicit (i.e. not present in the speech signal). What is pragmatics? \u00b6 Definition \u00b6 Pragmatics is the study of inferred meaning . Difference between pragmatics and semantics \u00b6 (a) The sentence versus the utterance \u00b6 Pragmatics can be contrasted with semantics which is the study of encoded meaning . While semantics is concerned with the sentence , i.e. a series of linguistic symbols which is devoid of context, pragmatics is concerned with the utterance , i.e. sentences which are produced in a specific context. This context encompasses who said the utterances, how the utterance was being used in a conversation, and whether there are any intentions behind the utterance. In other words, the utterances is a specific sentence produced in a particular context , at a particular moment , by a particular speaker . Here are two examples to demonstrate this difference The bin is full Its explicit meaning is merely the proposition that THE BIN IS FULL. It may have a number of implicit meanings depending on context. When my other half tells me that the bin is full, she really means that I need to empty the bin because it is overflowing, and the dogs will start eating the rubbish. I'm a bit short of cash. Its explicit meaning is the proposition that THE SPEAKER DOES NOT HAVE MUCH MONEY. But it can have a number of implicit meanings depending on the context. For example, if someone has just asked \"Are you going to take the job?\" it probably means \"Yes.\" If someone has just asked \"Are you coming to the pub?\" it probably means \"No.\" When pragmaticists (people who study pragmatics) refer to context, it can take on a variety of meanings: Type of context Definition Linguistic context Relationship of utterance to what has been previously said (discourse). E.g. is the utterance said in reply to a question Physical context Physical context in which the environment takes place, e.g. is the speaker pointing at something? Interpersonal context Speakers\u2019 shared knowledge. What the speakers know about each other\u2019s beliefs, goals and mental states. What the speakers are trying to do to each other, e.g. inform, apologise, persuade Social / cultural context Social roles of speakers / social status of speakers / cultural norms. E.g. if you started an interview with \"Hey dude!\" you probably wouldn't get the job (b) Truth-conditionality \u00b6 Have a look at this exchange A: What did you think of the meal? B: The starters were good. A: So the rest of the meal wasn't very nice? B: No, that was nice too! We can see that after B's first utterance, A would most likely make the inference that the rest of the meal wasn't good. But they decide to double-check this inference. B then replies that the rest of the meal was in fact good. (NB you could argue that B is not being a very pragmatically sophisticated communicator as they have allowed A to make an inference which is not true, but this kind of situation often happens!) This example demonstrates the difference between truth-conditional and non-truth-conditional meaning. The explicit / encoded meaning of \"The starters were good\" is the proposition that THE STARTERS WERE GOOD. This is truth-conditional as it is capable of being true or false (depending on whether the starters were good). However, the inference that the rest of the meal wasn't very nice is not truth-conditional, because we can see that it can be cancelled by the speaker (B). We describe inferences as being defeasible or cancellable . Semantics is the study of truth-conditional meaning, while pragmatics is the study of non-truth-conditional meaning. The range of pragmatics \u00b6 Pragmatics covers a massive range of linguistic phenomena ranging from simple to complex inferences. An example of a simple inference is reference assignment , e.g. \"Have you met John? He 's my best friend.'\" We are most likely to infer that he refers to John because it is the most recently mentioned Noun Phrase. However, it could feasibly refer to a different entity. An example of a complex inference is figurative language such as metaphor . When Princess Diana spoke about her close relationship with her butler, Paul Burrell, she referred to him as \"her rock \", i.e. someone she could depend on. However, in a different context, it may mean something completely different, e.g. if someone says \"you are like a rock \" to their romantic partner, it probably means they are being cold, distant and withdrawn (NB technically this is simile , but it is closely related to metaphor). Metaphor is much more complex than reference-assignment as it involves making connections between literal and nonliteral meanings. In addition, to covering a wide range of phenomena, the term \"pragmatics\" means different things to different people. When linguists use the term they tend to refer to \"linguistic pragmatics\", i.e. the process o interpreting utterances in context using linguistic inference. However, it is also used to describe someone's general communicative / conversational ability, e.g. their ability to use turn-taking, their ability to create coherent discourses (i.e. they don't suddenly switch topic). A speech and language therapist is more likely to use the latter definition. Basic concepts in pragmatics \u00b6 Basic concepts I: Intention recognition \u00b6 Being able to read the intention behind an utterance is a fundamental prerequisite of pragmatic communication. We can see this at play when interpretation speech errors, e.g. Could you pass me the salad? (English lanaguage learner intends to say \"salt\") Did you see the alligator? (Produced by a tourist taking a cruise down the Nile) I he left it in the par cark (Sound swap) In each of these contexts you probably would not try to correct the speaker as their intended meaning is very clear. To demonstrate the importance of intention recognition think about this example: It is a beautiful day in the mountains with some light cloud. A tourist says to the inn keeper \"I'm going for a walk up the mountain\". The inn keeper replies \"It's starting to get cloudy.\" Clearly the inn keeper is trying to warn the tourist. Possible inferences are (a) the inn keeper knows that it will take a long time to get to the top, so it\u2019s best to be prepared for bad weather, (b) the inn keeper knows that the weather on the mountain is unpredictable (c) the inn keeper knows that in this part of the world, light cloud in the morning tends to turn into rain by midday. These are all very important inferences to make, or the tourist could get into trouble! Note that these inferences can only arise if the tourist is attempting to read the intention behind the utterances, i.e. the inn keeper is intending to warn the tourist. Language is a form of \u2018 intentional communication \u2019. This is because interpreting an utterance involves not just decoding the truth-conditional meaning, but inferring the intention behind the utterance Basic concepts II: Choosing the right assumptions (premises) \u00b6 Take a look at this example A: Would you like a coffee? B: Coffee would keep me awake. How one interprets this depends on what assumptions one makes. If A assumes that B would like to go to bed (e.g. to get a good night's sleep before an exam), then they would interpret their utterance as meaning \"no\". If A assumes that B would like to stay awake (e.g. to do some last minute cramming), then they would interpret their utterance as meaning \"yes\". Basic concepts III: Choosing the right interpretation \u00b6 However, even if we have access to all the relevant contextual information, sometimes we do not make the right interpretation, e.g. A: What do you intend to do today? B: I have a terrible headache. Here are all the possible inferences that A could make: B feels too unwell to decide what to do, B feels too unwell to answer the question, B plans to pop out to get some aspirin, B plans to spend the rest of the day in bed. The riskiness of pragmatic communication \u00b6 Because it is not always possible to read the speaker's intentions, access the right assumptions (premises), or choose the right interpretation, pragmatic communication is fraught with risk . An interesting question is why humans have developed a communication system in which communication breakdowns are so likely to occur. Austin's Speech Act Theory \u00b6 The basics \u00b6 This was pioneered by J.L. Austin in his 1962 book \"How to do things with words.\" It was one of the first pragmatic theories to address the issue of intention recognition . According to his approach we \"do things\" with sentences, e.g. we say sentences to warn , inform , or persuade . The thing we do with the sentence is the speech act or illocution . There is a finite list of possible speech acts, which makes the task of identifying the appropriate illocution much easier. We can determine the speech act of a sentence if we paraphrase it using a performative verb (a verb which expresses the speech act), e.g. Would you like to come to the party? \u2192 The speaker is inviting the addressee to come to a party. Interpreting the speech act involves paraphrasing the sentence using a performative verb. This is the performative hypothesis . (NB sometimes the performative verb may be explicitly stated, e.g. \"I would like to invite you to the party\" but most of the time the performative verb is left implicit). Austin conceptualises the utterance on three different levels. In the middle is the speech act or illocution. This proceeds from the locution (the explicit / truth-conditional meaning of the utterance). There is also a level the perlocution which is the general (as opposed to specific) goal of the utterance and its overall effect on the listener. Here is an example for the utterance I'll tidy my room : Level Name Definition Description 1 Locution Explicit content The speaker will tidy their room at some point in the future 2 Illocution (or Speech Act) What the speaker \"does\" with the utterance He PROMISED he would tidy his room 3 Perlocution General goal and overall effect on listener The child wants to impress their parents (and maybe increase the probability that they will be allowed to watch a horror film) According to Austin, illocutions / speech acts are chosen from a finite list. Here is list he proposed: Greeting, Promise, Congratulation, Threat, Question (aka \u2018request for information\u2019), Comment, Offer, Attention getter, Request, Command. He referred to the last three as directives . The choice of speech act will depend on the context. e.g. the sentence \"There is some cake on the table\" could be, a complaint to the waiter in a caf\u00e9, a warning not to let the dog into the room where the cake is, an invitation to take some of the cake, an accusation made against a fridge-raiding teenager. Felicity conditions \u00b6 To help choose the appropriate speech act, each carries a set of felicity conditions , i.e. conditions which need to be met for the speech act to acheive its purpose (perlocution), e.g. Sentence Speech act Felicity conditions I pronounce you man and wife An act of \"marrying\" The person who says this must have the relevant authority I'm so sorry An apology The apology must be genuine and heartelt (e.g. compare with an ironic apology: \"I'm so SOH-ree!\") Come to a party! An invitation Speaker and hearer are friends or there is a potential for friendship Did you do the homework? A (genuine) question The speaker does not have a particular piece of information. They think that the hearer is likely to have that information. The speaker wishes to find out that piece of information. The felicity conditions can help determine the speech act. E.g. if a lecturer asks \"What is a preposition?\", this violates the felicity conditions for a genuine question, as the lecturer is likely to know the answer. This causes the student to interpret this question as a RHETORICAL QUESTION, i.e. not a genuine question. Pros and cons \u00b6 The provides an account of how we determine the underlying intention behind the utterances, which is clearly very important in pragmatic communication. However, it is not clear that there is a finite limit on the different types of speech acts. It also does not allow for phatic communication , when we use language purely with the intention to build a relationship with the hearer, e.g. \"It's a lovely day today isn't it?\". Here there is an evident perlocution, to start a conversation, but no clear illocution.","title":"01 Introduction to Pragmatics and SA Theory"},{"location":"Linguistics%202%20lecture%20notes/01%20Pragmatics%201/#01-introduction-to-pragmatics-and-sa-theory","text":"","title":"01 Introduction to Pragmatics and SA Theory"},{"location":"Linguistics%202%20lecture%20notes/01%20Pragmatics%201/#the-code-view-of-language","text":"","title":"The code view of language"},{"location":"Linguistics%202%20lecture%20notes/01%20Pragmatics%201/#what-is-the-code-view","text":"According to this view language consists of symbols which allow perfect transmission of the message we are conveying.

Austin in his 1962 book \"How to do things with words.\" It was one of the first pragmatic theories to address the issue of intention recognition . According to his approach we \"do things\" with sentences, e.g. we say sentences to warn , inform , or persuade . The thing we do with the sentence is the speech act or illocution . There is a finite list of possible speech acts, which makes the task of identifying the appropriate illocution much easier. We can determine the speech act of a sentence if we paraphrase it using a performative verb (a verb which expresses the speech act), e.g. Would you like to come to the party? \u2192 The speaker is inviting the addressee to come to a party. Interpreting the speech act involves paraphrasing the sentence using a performative verb. This is the performative hypothesis . (NB sometimes the performative verb may be explicitly stated, e.g. \"I would like to invite you to the party\" but most of the time the performative verb is left implicit). Austin conceptualises the utterance on three different levels. In the middle is the speech act or illocution. This proceeds from the locution (the explicit / truth-conditional meaning of the utterance). There is also a level the perlocution which is the general (as opposed to specific) goal of the utterance and its overall effect on the listener. Here is an example for the utterance I'll tidy my room : Level Name Definition Description 1 Locution Explicit content The speaker will tidy their room at some point in the future 2 Illocution (or Speech Act) What the speaker \"does\" with the utterance He PROMISED he would tidy his room 3 Perlocution General goal and overall effect on listener The child wants to impress their parents (and maybe increase the probability that they will be allowed to watch a horror film) According to Austin, illocutions / speech acts are chosen from a finite list. Here is list he proposed: Greeting, Promise, Congratulation, Threat, Question (aka \u2018request for information\u2019), Comment, Offer, Attention getter, Request, Command. He referred to the last three as directives . The choice of speech act will depend on the context. e.g. the sentence \"There is some cake on the table\" could be, a complaint to the waiter in a caf\u00e9, a warning not to let the dog into the room where the cake is, an invitation to take some of the cake, an accusation made against a fridge-raiding teenager.","title":"The basics"},{"location":"Linguistics%202%20lecture%20notes/01%20Pragmatics%201/#felicity-conditions","text":"To help choose the appropriate speech act, each carries a set of felicity conditions , i.e. conditions which need to be met for the speech act to acheive its purpose (perlocution), e.g. Sentence Speech act Felicity conditions I pronounce you man and wife An act of \"marrying\" The person who says this must have the relevant authority I'm so sorry An apology The apology must be genuine and heartelt (e.g. compare with an ironic apology: \"I'm so SOH-ree!\") Come to a party! An invitation Speaker and hearer are friends or there is a potential for friendship Did you do the homework? A (genuine) question The speaker does not have a particular piece of information. They think that the hearer is likely to have that information. The speaker wishes to find out that piece of information. The felicity conditions can help determine the speech act. E.g. if a lecturer asks \"What is a preposition?\", this violates the felicity conditions for a genuine question, as the lecturer is likely to know the answer. This causes the student to interpret this question as a RHETORICAL QUESTION, i.e. not a genuine question.","title":"Felicity conditions"},{"location":"Linguistics%202%20lecture%20notes/01%20Pragmatics%201/#pros-and-cons","text":"The provides an account of how we determine the underlying intention behind the utterances, which is clearly very important in pragmatic communication.

The \"form\" of the sentence is sometimes called the \"mood\". Mood Form Speech Act DECLARATIVE I am eating chips Comment INTERROGATIVE Are you _ eating chips? (Movement of auxiliary are ) Question IMPERATIVE Eat it now! No subject + infinitive verb form Directive But sometimes the mood of the sentence, and the speech act are mismatched. Can you come to the party? MOOD = Interrogative DIRECT SPEECH ACT (corresponding to mood) = Question INDIRECT SPEECH ACT (main function of utterance) = Invitation Which of the following sentences involve indirect speech acts? Can you turn the music down? Am I tired, or what? What were the causes of the First World War? I presume you packed your passport? Have a nice day! Take me to your leader! Have you heard the news? Students should submit work punctually. Declarative mood functioning as a non-comment speech act \u00b6 That music is too loud! = DIRECTIVE You've had enough cake! = DIRECTIVE I presume you packed your passport? = QUESTION I don't suppose you could lend lend me ten quid? = QUESTION Interrogative form functioning as non-question speech act \u00b6 Can you turn the music down? = DIRECTIVE What were the causes of the First World War? In the context of a written exam, seminar or viva = DIRECTIVE In the context of a lecture = RHETORICAL QUESTION Am I tired, or what!? = EXCLAMATIVE Do I look like I care? = EXPRESSING LACK OF CONCERN Have you heard the news? = INTRODUCING NEWS?? Function of indirect speech act \u00b6 They are often used to soften directives, and avoid \"loss of face\". \"Face\" = social status. If formulates a direct directive, e.g. Wash the dishes! , then if I comply, my face (social status) is threatened, e.g. it looks as if I am weak. However, if an indirect request is made, e.g. Could you possibly wash the dishes? , and I comply, my social status is less undermined. Conventional ways to make indirect speech acts \u00b6 There are a variety of conventional ways to soften directives, e.g. (S = Speaker, H = Hearer) Questioning H\u2019s ability: Can you pass me that pen? Expressing S\u2019s wishes : *I wish you wouldn\u2019t do that Questioning* H\u2019s future action: Aren\u2019t you going to drink your coffee? Questioning* H\u2019s desire / willingness: Do you want to pass me that pen? Commenting on reasons for action: It\u2019d be helpful if you arrived early Tentatively using an explicit performative : Could I ask you to open the door? The first method, questioning someone's ability, is probably the most common approach to soften a directive. When making invitations, we often use an imperative form, e.g. Come to a party! When developing our pragmatic competence, we need to understand the range of conventions which are used to make indirect speech acts. Arriving at the indirect speech act \u00b6 Indirect speech acts frequently involve interpreting the direct speech act, and then determining that this is not the intended speech act, e.g. Can you pass me the pen? DIRECT SPEECH ACT: Question related to someon's ability INDIRECT SPEECH ACT: Request According to Searle (1969) we identify the direct speech act, but realise that this does not obey the felicity conditions, e.g. it is obvious that the hearer is able to pass the pen, and so therefore it is unlikely that the speaker does not know this. This causes the hearer to make an inferential question to uncover the indirect speech act. NB sometimes we may choose to interpret the direct speech act for the purposes of comedy or sarcasm, e.g. TEACHER: What were the causes of the First World War? STUDENT: You should know, surely!? A: Can you pass me that pen? I can, but I don't feel like it. Notice that sometimes people with pragmatic impairments interpret the direct, and not the indirect speech act: A: Can you tell me about it? (\u201cit\u201d refers to TV programme) B: Yes. A: Will tell me about it. What\u2019s it like? B: The man always fights the bad men\u2026 McTear (1985) referenced by Cummings (2015) in Pragmatic and Discourse Disorders . B is a 10-year old boy with pragmatic difficulties. Implicature \u00b6 Properties of implicature \u00b6 This is the implied meaning of the utterance. This is calculated using inference and contextual information . An example we have seen before is A: Did you enjoy the meal? B: The starters were good. IMPLICATURE: The rest of the meal was not good. An important property of implicatures is that they are defeasible , i.e. cancellable, deniable. The following examples demonstrate this property: Did you enjoy the meal? The starters were good... and in fact so was the rest of it. Are you going to take the job? Well, I'm pretty short of cash... but that's the last job in the world that I'd do. Defeasibility is a characteristic of non-truth-conditional meaning Conventional and conversational implicature \u00b6 Conventional implicature \u00b6 Conventional implicatures are triggered by explicit content, e.g. words. Conversational implicatures are not triggered by explicit content. The following sentences generate conventional implicatures: Bert even cleaned up the bedroom Implication that this information is suprising, that he cleaned up other rooms, and possibly that his bedroom is the messiest thing of all! He was 42 but the clothes catalogues still hired him as a model Implication that the job would not normally be offered to someone of his age. Notice how both these implicatures are triggered by particular words: even (focus particle), but (coordinating conjunction) and still (adverb). Here are some other words which generate conventional implicatures: Here are some other examples of words which trigger conventional implicatures: Adverbs which show relationships between sentences / clauses; however, moreover, therefore, after all , e.g. Peter was at the party. However , she still had a good time. Quantifiers; some , e.g. Jenny read some of the books (implicature that she did not read all of them) Verbs: try , e.g. Jack tried to light the fire (implicature that he did not succeed) Notice how conventional implicatures, just like conversational implicatures, are defeasible, e.g. Jenny read some of the books... in fact she read all of them Jack tried to light the fire... in fact he succeeded. Conversational implicature \u00b6 These are different to conventional implicatures in that they are triggered by meaning , not form, e.g. A: Did you enjoy the film? B: I stayed awake / I didn't fall asleep Both sentences lead to the same implicature because they have similar / identical meanings, even though their form differs greatly. Compare this with conventional implicatures, in which specific words trigger the implicature. (NB this property is sometimes called \"non-detachability\" which is a silly term!) In additional, conversational implicatures must be intentional . For example, in the following conversation: A: What did you get in the exam? B: I passed. A might derive the implicature that B is upset about their grade. However, we can imagine a situation where A did really well, but does not wish to boast of their high score because C, who failed the exam is present. A might infer B's reasons for being vague, but this is not an implicature as it was not intended by B. As mentioned, above, conversational implicatures are, by nature, defeasible . They are context dependent , e.g. A: Are you coming to the pub? B: I'm a bit short of cash (= no) A: Are you going to take the job? B: I'm a bit short of cash (= yes) They are calculable using general principles. For example, if a husband and wife use a code word which means \"let's leave this party, it's getting dull\", this does not generate an implicature, because no one else will be able to understand it. In summary, the qualities of an implicature are as follows: a. Triggered by meaning (not form) b. Intended c. Defeasible d. Context-dependent e. Calculable Conventional implicatures have all the same properties with the exception of (a) because conventional implicatures are triggered by specific words. Accounting for implicatures - Grice's Maxims \u00b6 What are maxims? \u00b6 Paul Grice (1913 - 1988) provided one of the first (and arguably most important) accounts to explain how implicatures are made. His approach is sometimes called \"Grice's Maxims\". These are broad guidelines for cooperative behaviour. The maxims are subsumed by an overarching principle called the Cooperative Principle . Grice summarises this as follows: \u201cMake your conversational contribution such as is required, at the stage at which it occurs, by the accepted purpose or direction of the talk exchange in which you are engaged\u201d Grice (1975). In conversation, speakers tend to cooperate and assume that the other person is cooperating. So there is a mutual assumption of cooperation. There is also an assumption that if someone is cooperating they are following the conversational maxims / Grice's maxims . These are more specific versions of the cooperative principle. The maxims are as follows: Maxim of quality : \u2018Be truthful\u2019 Try to make your contribution one that is true. Do not say that which you believe to be false. Do not say that for which you lack adequate evidence. Maxim of quantity : 'Be brief' Make your contribution as informative as is required (for the current purposes of the exchange). Do not make your contribution more informative than is required. Example: A: I don't have a pen . B: Peter's got one . Peter may have ten pens, but if B were to respond Peter's got ten , this would be overly informaive. Maxim of manner : 'Be brief' Make your contribution as informative as is required (for the current purposes of the exchange). Do not make your contribution more informative than is required. Maxim of relation : 'Be clear' Make your contributions relevant. Be perspicuous (ie clear, lucid). Avoid ambiguity. Avoid obscurity of expression. Avoid unnecessary prolixity (don\u2019t waffle) Be orderly, e.g. don't say he rode off and jumped on his horse , even though it may be literally true. How do they lead to implicatures? \u00b6 When a maxim is not obeyed there are four different possibilities: The Speaker deliberately violates (or \"flouts\") the maxims. This results in a chain of inference which leads to an implicature . The Speaker violates the maxims because they are difficult to obey (e.g. for social reasons). This will result in a chain of inference, but not an implicature, e.g. the example above where B says I passed to avoid hurting C's feelings. The Speaker is a na\u00efve communicator who is not good at adhering to maxims. The Speaker is lying (in the case of departures from the maxim of quality). Here is an interaction which involves flouting: A: Would you like a coffee? B: Coffee would keep me awake. This is clearly not a direct response. It (arguably) violates the maxim of relation, as it is not, at least superficially, relevant. It also violates the maxim of quantity, as it is underinformative. However, according to the cooperative principle, A assumes that B's response must be relevant / informative in some way. They therefore undertake an inferential quest to determine the relevance / informativeness of the response, e.g. B wants to stay awake to revise and therefore B would like a coffee, or B wants to get a good night's sleep and therefore does not want a coffee. (NB why not just reply \"yes\" or \"no\"? By replying indirectly, B may be tacitly reminding A that they have an exam tomorrow, and therefore not to play loud music). Other example of maxim violations \u00b6 Violation of maxim of quantity \u00b6 A: Did you clean the fridge? B: I cleaned the fridge, the cooker and the oven. IMPLICATURE: I'm doing my fair share of the housework. Dear sir, Mr X\u2019s command of English is excellent, and his attendance at tutorials has been regular. Yours faithfully, .... IMPLICATURE: He is not a strong candidate. Violation of maxim of quality \u00b6 This bag weighs a tonne. IMPLICATURE: It is very heavy. Violation of maxim of manner \u00b6 A: I hear you went to the opera last night; how was the lead singer? B: The singer produced a series of sounds corresponding closely to the score of an aria from 'Rigoletto'. (Levinson 1983) IMPLICATURE: The singer wasn't very good. Violation of maxim of relation \u00b6 A: Can I borrow a fiver? B: My wallet's on the table. IMPLICATURE: Yes, please take a fiver from my wallet. Evaluation of Grice's account \u00b6 It is an improvement on speech act theory in the sense that it provides a specific trigger for making inferences (flouting of maxims). It also covers a wider range of phenomena, e.g. speech acts (e.g. interpretation of an indirect speech act may involve a violation of a maxim), conversational implicatures, and metaphor / irony. However, the theory does not explain where the maxims or the cooperative principle come from, e.g. are they cognitive or cultural? It has also been argued that adherence to maxims varies across cultures, e.g. speakers of Malagasy (Polynesia) downgrade the maxim of quantity, often giving uninformative responses (Keenan, 1976)","title":"Speech Act Theory II and Implicatures"},{"location":"Linguistics%202%20lecture%20notes/02%20Pragmatics%202/#speech-act-theory-ii-and-implicatures","text":"","title":"Speech Act Theory II and Implicatures"},{"location":"Linguistics%202%20lecture%20notes/02%20Pragmatics%202/#indirect-speech-acts","text":"","title":"Indirect Speech Acts"},{"location":"Linguistics%202%20lecture%20notes/02%20Pragmatics%202/#introduction","text":"For many utterances, there is a direct mapping between the \"form\" of the sentence and the speech act.

Avoid unnecessary prolixity (don\u2019t waffle) Be orderly, e.g. don't say he rode off and jumped on his horse , even though it may be literally true.","title":"What are maxims?"},{"location":"Linguistics%202%20lecture%20notes/02%20Pragmatics%202/#how-do-they-lead-to-implicatures","text":"When a maxim is not obeyed there are four different possibilities: The Speaker deliberately violates (or \"flouts\") the maxims. This results in a chain of inference which leads to an implicature . The Speaker violates the maxims because they are difficult to obey (e.g. for social reasons). This will result in a chain of inference, but not an implicature, e.g. the example above where B says I passed to avoid hurting C's feelings. The Speaker is a na\u00efve communicator who is not good at adhering to maxims. The Speaker is lying (in the case of departures from the maxim of quality). Here is an interaction which involves flouting: A: Would you like a coffee? B: Coffee would keep me awake. This is clearly not a direct response. It (arguably) violates the maxim of relation, as it is not, at least superficially, relevant. It also violates the maxim of quantity, as it is underinformative. However, according to the cooperative principle, A assumes that B's response must be relevant / informative in some way. They therefore undertake an inferential quest to determine the relevance / informativeness of the response, e.g. B wants to stay awake to revise and therefore B would like a coffee, or B wants to get a good night's sleep and therefore does not want a coffee. (NB why not just reply \"yes\" or \"no\"? By replying indirectly, B may be tacitly reminding A that they have an exam tomorrow, and therefore not to play loud music).","title":"How do they lead to implicatures?"},{"location":"Linguistics%202%20lecture%20notes/02%20Pragmatics%202/#other-example-of-maxim-violations","text":"","title":"Other example of maxim violations"},{"location":"Linguistics%202%20lecture%20notes/02%20Pragmatics%202/#violation-of-maxim-of-quantity","text":"A: Did you clean the fridge?

It also covers a wider range of phenomena, e.g. speech acts (e.g. interpretation of an indirect speech act may involve a violation of a maxim), conversational implicatures, and metaphor / irony. However, the theory does not explain where the maxims or the cooperative principle come from, e.g. are they cognitive or cultural? It has also been argued that adherence to maxims varies across cultures, e.g. speakers of Malagasy (Polynesia) downgrade the maxim of quantity, often giving uninformative responses (Keenan, 1976)","title":"Evaluation of Grice's account"}]}
