Interpretation 'no thanks' is only derivable if sentence is produced in the appropriate context What is phonology? Ask Ghada and Jalal!! Crossing over While it is tempting to think in neat subfields, many phenomena cross over e.g. The meaning of verbs (semantics) determines the number of participants in a sentence, which in turn determines the structure. John [1] gave Mary [2] a book [3] Because of these cross-over phenomena, linguists often talk about the 'interfaces' between the different subdomains, e.g. the syntax-semantic interface. Subfields of linguistics Theoretical linguistics : investigates the nature of linguistic knowledge. IMPORTANT QUESTIONS: Are we born with knowledge of language? How do we explain similarities and differences across languages? Psycholinguistics : investigates how we comprehend and produce language. IMPORTANT QUESTIONS: Is the human mind similar to desktop computer? Does the language we speak affect the way we think? Sociolinguistics : investigates how and why language varies across different social classes and groupings. Sociolinguists explore how language expresses or \"indexes\" social identity. William Labov is one of the pioneers in this area, with his seminal study on accent in Martha's Vinyard. If language indexes social identity, then criticism of the language they use can be construed as an attack on their identity. Discourse studies : How we use language to persuade / exert power relationships. Approaches to language structure Prescriptive grammars - how we SHOULD speak (1) Double negative : I haven't got no money / I can't get no satisfaction Acceptable in certain dialects (e.g. London English) and languages (e.g. Spanish). It does not cause confusion as many prescriptivists claim. (2) Use of innit as a tag question It was a great meal, wasn't it / innit ? You're Jack's nephew, aren't you / innit ?

Data from production errors Have a look at these errors. How/why have they occured? They misunderestimated me They can refudiate what this group is saying I'm on my way to the lection I don't expose anyone will eat that These errors are known as 'blends'. Two words are activated, and combined into one, e.g. expect + suppose -> expose / misunderstand + underestimate -> misunderestimate . Note that when this happens there is often a phonological 'pivot' (my terminology) in the middle of word, i.e. material shared across both words. For exampel, the p in expect / suppose Characteristics: (1) Multiple Semantic Activation: overlapping meanings (2) Phonological processes in selection: similar word-internal phonology. Process by which blends are formed combines opportunistic activation / assembly with rigorous monitoring What does it tell us about words? They are stored in semantic and networks (activation of multiple words with overlapping meanings). There is activation across domains : semantic activation of multiple competitors, and phonological processes involved in blending (the use of a 'pivot'). The system biases speed over accuracy , but recovers from error due to a monitoring system . Meaning-related sense-relationships Hyponymy 'Hypo' = under, 'nym' = word Plant > Tree > Sycamore / Plant > Flower > Daisy / Furniture > Chair > Stool A subset relationship. As you go upwards, extension (potential referents) expands, intension (list of definitional properties) narrows. Tree is a hyponym / subordinate of Plant Plant is a hyperonym / superordinate of Tree Mid-level categories are (a) more rapidly named, (b) more easily visualised, (c) acquired earlier Words which exist at the same level are called co-hyponyms or coordinates , e.g. daisy, begonia, Tulip / flower, bush, tree / chair, sofa, wardrobe. Synonmy 'Syn' = together, 'nym' = name/word Words with identical meanings. Very few genuine synonyms. When words are identical in denotation (event or thing they refer to), they differ in connotation (set of associations they trigger), e.g. chap / bloke / geezer (who would you buy a used car from?) , fiesta / knees up / bash / soir\u00e9e (which would you prefer to go to?) There are very few genuine synonyms, i.e. where denotation and connotation are teh same. Some examples are words differing across dialects or varieties of a language, e.g. tap / fawcett, pavement / sidewalk , and some grammatical words, e.g. however / nonetheless Antonmy 'Anto' = opposite, 'nym' = name/word Words with opposite meanings. Can be gradable (e.g. slightly hot , very cold ) or non-gradable (e.g. * very dead ) Sometimes there is no obvious opposite, e.g. the opposite of virgin . There is a 'lexical gap' Homonymy 'Homo' = same, 'nym' = name/word. Same form, but no obvious meaning relationship. Words have similar forms due to ' historical accident '. May have same root (in which case there is a tenuous meaning relationship), e.g. a table of numbers, versus the kitchen table Or may have a different root, e.g. bay tree [LATIN baca], the ship entered the bay [OLD FRENCH baie], the dogs bayed [OLD FRENCH abai]. The fact that these words, with different an unrelated meanings, have the same pronunciation is a historical accident. Polysemy 'Poly' = multiple, 'sem' = meaning. Same form, and different but related meanings. The meaning relationship is mentally represented Prepositions are notoriously polysemous, e.g. over = straight movement in contact with a plane, e.g. he ran over the field , or over = two dimensional movement across a bounded plane, e.g. the balloon floated over the city (or possibly there is no movement at all), or over = random movement covering a plane_, e.g. he poured ketchup over the chips_. Other polysemous words; He went to bed , a river- bed , flower bed , the steak was served on a bed of lettuce The cup was full , the room was full , she has a full schedule, she leads a full life. Are meaning relationships systematic or random? According to Charles Fillmore (e.g. Fillmore & Atkins, 2000), there is a central sense, with all meanings radiating from this central sense, e.g. all meanings of over share the idea that the 'figure' (smaller object) is, at some stage, above the 'ground' (larger object). All meanings of bed involve a flat surface made of a relatively soft material. When teaching a polysemous word, it may be best to start with the central meaning (or 'sense') of the word, and later teach the more peripheral meanings (e.g. Tyler & Evans, 2004) Homonyms versus Polysemes Both describe words with same form, but different meanings. The only difference is whether the meaning relationship is mentally represented . Moreover, according to Fillmore's approach meaning relationships among polysemous words are structure / systematic. The only way to test this is via personal intuition. Lexical gaps A language lacks a word where there should be one. Easily demonstrated with antonyms Opposite of bald? Opposite of virgin? Many English kinship terms are vague, e.g. English cousin can be used for a variety of different relations, while Sudanese has different words for every type of cousin. Loan words, e.g. kitsch & schadenfreude , are used to fill lexical gaps. A recent load word is hygge . Form-related relationships Homophony Same spoken form, different written forms (with different meanings) e.g. might / mite, leak / leek Homography Same written form, different spoken forms (with different meanings) e.g. bow, minute Exploring semantic networks Word association norms A says a word, and B says the first word that comes into their heads Coordinates are the most frequent category, e.g. if the prime is cat , the participant says dog . Next are collocations (words which tend to co-occur, e.g. fish and chips , cats and dogs ). Then come superordinates, e.g. cat primes pet , and finally subordinates ( cat primes Siamese ). Word association tasks conducted with children with Developmental Language Impairments find tentative evidence for reduced semantic networks, e.g. large number of responses which are very odd, e.g. Spoon -> Disney, or based on phonological similarity, e.g. cow -> how (Sheng & McGregor, 2010) Semantic fluency tasks A asks B to say as many words as possible from a single category, e.g. animals, things you take on holidays. When asked to list animals, a typical response might be Dog, cat, rabbit -- lion, tiger -- fish, whale, dolphin Responses tend to be grouped into clusters, e.g. the above response contains a DOMESTIC ANIMAL cluster, then a WILD ANIMAL cluster, then a SEA MAMMAL cluster. Poorer semantic fluency in developmental language disorders and autism (Kail & Leonard, 1986; Bishop & Norbury, 2005). For example, they produce fewer words and clusters Some have suggested that semantic fluency tasks can be used to predict onset of Alzheimmers: few clusters, cluster members and switches between clusters (Gomez & White, 2006) Lexical priming task e.g. does hearing word X spead up recognition / recall of word Y? Exploring word production using lexcial speech errors Types of error: Blend, e.g. lection Phonological substitution (malapropism), e.g. The Chinese emperor had many concubines -> porcupines, Brexit means Brexit -> breakfast. Semantic substitution, e.g. Give me the hammer -> screwdriver. Tip of the tongue effects = we know the meaning of the word we want, but phonological access is partial Available evidence suggests 2-stage model: (1) Activation of meaning, (2) Activation of form. The meaning level is called the 'lemma' level. We will revisit this concept in week 10. 5-minute Exercise How many 'units of meaning' in the following words: Dogs Laughed Working Believe Unbelievable Sang Bibliography Kail, R., & Leonard, L.

For example reaction times indicate that we parse pseudo-inflections, e.g. mil d (potentially past tense of the verb to mile ) as actual inflections. Words with regular inflectional affixes tend to be phonotactically irregular (e.g. irregular lost rhymes with frost , but regular turned does not rhyme with any other monomorphemic word). This suggests they are not stored. Evidence of the whole-word storage of morphologically-complex words Some complex forms contain non-word roots , indicating that they haven't been built up compositionally, e.g. Un remitt ingly It's in evit able The food supplies were de plete d Some morphemes have multiple meanings, e.g. -er = AGENT, e.g. gardener , or INSTRUMENT, e.g. paint stripper . If words are built up compositionally, how do we know which meaning of -er to select? Psycholinguistic evidence indicates that some morphologically-complex forms are stored as wholes, e.g. Loscewicz (1995) found that inflections in high-frequency inflected forms were significantly shorter than in low-frequency inflected forms -> high-frequency forms were stored as a whole. Alegre and Gordon (1999) found a relationship between whole-word frequency and performance on a nonword discrimination task when whole-word frequency exceeded 1 per 7 million. A hybrid view There is strong evidence for both computational and whole word accounts. Novel inflected forms, e.g. meek ed , must be generated by adding the morpheme. Words with non-word roots, e.g. unre mitt ingly clearly cannot be generated compositionally. So we have two possible** routes to creating morphologically-complex words. High frequency morphologically complex forms are stored in the lexicon Lower frequency forms are generated by computational processes This reflects a trade-off between speed of processing, and expressivity. Whole-word storage of morphologically complex forms -> rapid processing. Separate storage of morphemes allows coining of novel morphologically complex forms, e.g. meek ed **. Pronunciation of mouth in Plymouth versus Cockermouth may reflect two systems (high frequency form, stored as a whole, involves schwa sounds (neutral vowel) The binary view may be too simple. Aitchison (2002) suggests a variety of different levels of storage. For example, the semantic transparency of morphemes (how interpretable they are) exhibits gradient properties. Fogglemouth = This is an imaginary town lying at the mouth of the river 'Foggle'. Suffix -mouth is fully transparent. It is applied using a productive rule > Grangemouth = A real town, but for those outside the Cumbria, this is likely to be a low-frequency word. It may be stored as a whole. Suffix -mouth is less transparent than the -mouth in Fogglemouth > Plymouth = High frquency word stored as unanalysed whole. Suffix mouth is less transparent than in Grangemouth . chickenless (FULLY PRODUCTIVE / TRANSPARENT) > careless (PARTIALLY PRODUCTIVE / TRANSPARENT) > gormless, ruthless (NOT PRODUCTIVE / TRANSPARENT) For chickenless , both morphemes are semantically transparen. The word looks derived. For careless , the morphemes are transparent, but we are likely to store and process the word as a whole. Finally, in gormless and ruthless the roots are not semantically transparent. Morphology in language impairments - Ullman and Pinker's Dual Route model Ullman and Pinker explain language difficulties in terms of the computational and lexical systems, and also give it a neuropsychological grounding. The computational system is governed by procedural memory (involved in the acquisition of unconscious, implicit routines), while the lexical system resides in declarative memory . In particular, they focus on verbs Irregular forms are stored as wholes in the lexicon Regular forms are generated via the computational system (NB Pinker and Ullman accept that high-frequency inflected forms may be stored in the lexicon) The two systems compete with each other under time pressure. If an irregular form is found, the computational process is blocked. If the irregular form is not found, the computational process takes over. Evidence: Frequency effects are only found in the irregular system only Children's overregularisation errors, e.g. she swammed are determined by the density of the irregular neighbourhood which the irregular root belongs to. Adult generation of inflected form is affected by input frequency only in the irregular system. Difficulties with regular forms are linked to impaired procedural memory Children with Developmental Language Disorder Adults with Parkinsons Adults with Broca's-type aphasia Difficulties with irregular forms are linked to impaired declarative memory Adults with Anomia Adults with Wernicke's type aphasia Criticism of the dual route model (1) Pseudo-regularity (irregular forms exhibit characteristics of regular forms) Irregulars exhibit characteristics of the regular system, e.g. verbs already ending in an alveolar plosive are more likely to be irregular, e.g. meet -> met, let -> let, put -> put, shut -> meet -> met , and nouns already ending in -s are more likely to take irregular plurals, e.g. goose -> geese, mouse -> mice, moose -> moose . This has led some researchers to argue that there are not two completely separate systems for regular and irregular forms, e.g. Joanisse and Seidenberg (1999) (2) The role of frequency The Dual Route model argues that frequency effects are characteristic of the lexical/declarative system, but not the computational system. Nonetheless, frequency effects also characterise the regular system (e.g. Losiewicz and Alegre & Gordon studies cited above) 5-minute exercise Which one of these sentences did Yoda say in the Star Wars trilogy?

Evidence: Frequency effects are only found in the irregular system only Children's overregularisation errors, e.g. she swammed are determined by the density of the irregular neighbourhood which the irregular root belongs to. Adult generation of inflected form is affected by input frequency only in the irregular system.

Bikavit gugo tunglish How did you complete the artificial language learning task? You figured out that particular positions in the sentences had particular FUNCTIONS. e.g. Subject, Verb, Object. Functions and sentence position Obligatory functions - Subjects and Verbs Almost all sentences of English needs a Subject and a Verb [ Syntax $ {SUBJECT}$ ] rocks! $ {VERB}$ [ Madonna $ {SUBJECT}$ ] sings $ {VERB}$ [ That donkey $ {SUBJECT}$ ] kicks! $ {VERB}$ The Subject is often the do-er, e.g. Madonna is the person who sings, and the donkey is the thing that kicks. However, in the following sentence Breakfast is served Breakfast is not the do-er. This shows that functions express a relationship which is only loosely linked to meaning . Functions express syntactic relationships , and are more closely related to sentence position than meaning. For example, in English, the Noun Phrase which comes immediately before the verb is always the Subject. In many languages the formal relationship between subject and verb is expressed via agreement . This means that the form of the verb is linked to the type of subject, e.g. Person Singular Plural 1st (speaker) I sing We sing 2nd (addressee) You sing You sing 3rd (person outside the conversation) She sing-s They sing We can see that the English paradigm is very sparse. However, other languages have much richer verb agreement paradigms, e.g. Spanish and Latin. Functions which are \"chosen\" by the verb (a) Objects After the verb, we often (but not always) have an Object Syntax rocks [ my world! $_{OBJECT}$ ] Madonna sings [ catchy tunes $_{OBJECT}$ ] That donkey kicks [ people $_{OBJECT}$ ] These are \"chosen\" by the verb in the sense that only certain verbs can take objects. For example, after the verbs yawn and run we typically do not have objects, e.g. He yawned She ran These are called intransitive verbs. Some verbs take two objects, in which case we have a direct and an indirect object . Direct Object (Od in LARSP) Indirect Object (Oi in LARSP) Meaning The thing which changes location / possession, e.g. She gave the ball to Jack The thing which receives the transferred entity, e.g. She gave the ball to Jack ** Animacy Often inanimate Often animate Syntax Does not come after a preposition Often comes after a preposition Note that the Indirect Object is \"parasitic\" on the Direct Object in the sense that it needs a Direct Object in order to be realised; Janet gave [ a book $_{Direct~Object}$] Janet gave [ a book $ {Direct~Object}$]. [ to Mary $ {Indirect~Object}$ ] ?? Janet gave [ to Mary $_{Indirect~Object}$ ] For the following sentences, which are the direct and indirect objects? Albert showed Victoria his stamp collection Ennis brought a book for Angie Could you rustle me up an omellete? Patricia sent her friend a letter NB sometimes there is more than one option to realise direct versus indirect objects: Abdul sent Josh a letter (called the \"Double Object Dative\") Abdul sent a letter to Josh (called the \"Prepositional Dative\") Od and Oi are \"chosen\" by the verb, in the sense that there are particular verbs which tend to take two objects. Groups of verbs taking two objects are verbs of physical transfer ( give, take, receive, lend, borrow, deliver, donate, show ) and verbs of metaphorical transfer ( tell, explain ) (b) Subject and Object complements Subject Complements (Cs) are phrases which describe a property of the subject , while Object Complements (Co) describe a property of the object . Here are some examples: Jack is [ terrible at maths ] = Cs describing Subject Jack Ali appears [ troubled ] at the moment = Cs describing Subject Ali I consider him [ my best friend ] = Co describing Object him I want that bedroom [ cleaned ] by tomorrow = Co describing Object bedroom Genevieve painted her bedroom walls [ dark green ] = Co describing Object her bedroom walls The mechanic hammered the panel [ flat ] = Co describing Object the panel Note that while Subjects and Objects are realised as Noun Phrases, Subject and Object Complements can be realised in many ways, e.g. as Adjective Phrases (e.g. terrible at maths ), or as Prepositional Phrases, e.g. he ripped the paper [ into pieces ] . Here is a list of verbs which tend to take complements Verbs which can take subject complements The copula - is/are/was/were Verbs of appearance - seem, appear, look, e.g. she seems / looks / appears tired Verbs of perception - *feel, smell, sound, taste, e.g. the food smells / tastes funny Verbs of persistence - stay, remain, e.g. You must stay / remain calm Verbs which can take object complements : appoint, call, certify, consider, crown, declare, elect, find, hold, imagine, keep, like, make, name, prefer, proclaim, profess, pronounce, prove, report, send, think, turn Complements are less moveable than objects. For example, in (1) and (2) below, we can move the objects to the front of the sentence. But this is not the case for complements (3) and (4) Jack gave Peter the book -> The book was given to Peter by Jack Jack gave Peter the book -> Peter was given the book by Jack Jack resembles Paul -> * Paul is resembled by Jack Magda named her daughter Isobel -> * Isobel was named her daughter by Magda NB these types of sentences are all examples of \"the passive\" which will be covered next semester Optional modifying functions Post-modifiers and Adverbials In many cases, the verb determines the functions which we can use, e.g. sit cannot be used with an Object Noun Phrase. Jack sat $*$ Jack sat [ the chair $_{OBJECT~NOUN~PHRASE}$] All of the above functions are, more-or-less, \"chosen\" by the verb. However, there are two functions which are not \"chosen\" by the verb: Adverbial and Postmodifier. An adverbial is a phrase (consisting of either a single word, or a group of words) which (a) modifies the verb or the sentence, and (b) occupies a \"peripheral\" position in the sentence, i.e. at the very beginning or the very end, and (c) can occur in EITHER peripheral position (i.e. it can be placed either at the beginning or end) [ On Tuesday ] we should have a picnic [ in my opinion ] [ With a bit of luck ] we will have good weather [ from tomorrow ] Though luckily in the following sentence has precisely the same function as the Adverbial with a bit of luck it is not peripheral, and therefore we are not categorising it as an adverbial. It is a adverb coming inside the Verb Complex. We [ luckily had $_{VERB~COMPLEX}$] good weather While Adverbials modify the verb, or sentence, Postmodifiers modify the Noun. They come after the noun, e.g. The man [ with the red hat ] followed me down the street The dog [ that scratched me ] was a Border Collie Functions and morphology Case-marking The syntactic function of a word or phrase may impact on its morphology. This phenomenon is called case-marking . A word whose morphology demonstrates its syntactic function is said to be case-marked . In English, case-marking only applies to Pronouns: Subject form (called NOMINATIVE or SUBJECTIVE case) = I, you, he/she/it, we, you, they Od, Oi, Cs, Co form (called ACCUSATIVE or OBJECTIVE form) = Me, you, him/her/it, us, you. them We also apply the GENITIVE CASE (denoting possession) to Nouns, e.g. She scratched Anna's car. Other language have much richer case systems, e.g. with special forms for direct versus indirect objects, and the possibility of marking case on Nouns as well as pronouns. Functions and language impairments Language-impaired children Language-impaired children occasionally omit subjects. This is a pattern found in younger typically-development children (Grela 1997, 2003) (He) went there. They also have case-marking difficulties in subject position, often using the accusative case, instead, e.g. Him go there. They also fail to inflect the verb which results in a loss of Subject-Verb agreement (as shown above, correct form of the verb is goes ) LARSP framework This is a framework for assessing child language taught in Linguistics II. It is designed to determine the child's syntactic level. To perform a LARSP analysis, you must determine the complexity of syntactic functions, e.g. She likes it = Simple one-word subject and object The girl likes the boy = Two-word subject and object containing Determiner + Noun combination. 5 minute exercise What is wrong with the following sentences?

Jack gave Mary Petula put the beans Julie laughed Peter Verbs select the number of entities in the sentence. Give and put select 3 participants, but there are only 2 in the sentence. Laugh selects 1 participant, but there are 2 in the sentence. Valence What is the valence of the following verbs? Drive Donate Mix Yawn Slap Rain A verb 'begs to be completed into a sentence' (Tomasello, 1992) The verb implies a certain number of participants (Valence) Valence can range from 0 to 3. Psycholinguistic studies demonstrate that even when we hear verbs in isolation we mentally represent the number of participants (e.g. Shapiro et al. 1987 lexical decision task, or Kim & Thomson, 2000) Thematic relations (roles) Look at the following sentences: Jane fears Peter Peter scares Jane Paul liked the play The play pleased Paul Mary gave Pete a present Pete received a present from Mary We can see that in order to use a verb properly, knowing the valence is not enough. We need to know which roles come in which positions. Otherwise we will get the meaning of the sentence wrong, e.g. we will say Jane scares Peter . Consequently, when using a verb in a sentence, we need to know (a) the number of participants, (b) their roles in the sentence, and (c) how those roles are ordered. Argument structure Definition Information included in the lexical entry of the verb, which specifies (a) the number of essential participants (valence), (b) their roles, and (c) the order of those roles. Essential participants are known as 'arguments' Argument structure is partly semantic / partly syntactic: Semantic level: roles specified by the verb Syntactic level: ordering of roles Non-essential participants are often classified as adverbials She beat the eggs [ with a whisk ] She topped the cake [ with cream ] She ate the bananas [ with custard ] She scoffed the cake [ with her best friend ] Which of the `with' phrases describe an essential participant? Could the event take place without it? Determining valency How do we determine essential participants? Those which are obligatory? We can test for obligatoriness by omitting an presumed argument, and seeing how this impacts on grammaticality She dropped ~~the pen~~ She took ~~the jacket~~ But most arguments can be rendered optional in certain contexts She give $[$ money $]$ to charity They all gave presents to Mary. Paul gave a pen (to Mary), Jenny gave a book (to Mary), and Brad gave a watch (to Mary) COOKING INSTRUCTIONS: Chop (the carrots) and stir (them) into the sauce So obligatoriness will only get you so far! In addition, some verbs seem to elicit a wide variety of arguments $[$ He $]$ paints $[$ walls $]$ $[$ He $]$ painted $[$ the wall $]$ $[$ red $]$ $[$ He $]$ painted $[$ the wall $]$ $[$ red $]$ $[$ with a paintbrush $]$ and $[$ some paint $]$ $[$ This brush $]$ paints well There are many potential arguments. Which ones are essential? Finally sometimes verbs can take \"extra-valent\" arguments which sound \"added on\" She swam $[$ ten lengths $]$ They laughed $[$ the teacher $]$ $[$ out of the room $]$ There is no foolproof way to determine valency Method 1: Work out which arguments are \"nearly\" obligatory by looking at at a corpus Method 2: Introspection. Shut your eyes and imagine the verb. How many entities are in the mental scene you have just conjured. These two methods can occasionally give different results! So there is no knock down method. If in doubt, shut your eyes, and click your heels together! Do we need argument structure? Why not just assume that the way we use words in sentences is a direct result of their meanings? This approach is sometimes described as a projectionist approach. 2 problems: Examples above ( Jane fears Peter / Peter scares Jane ) suggest that each verb must specify the order of the roles. A syntactic level of representation is arguably required for this, as we can't work out the order of arguments from the verb meaning ( fear and scare arguably convey the same situation, with the only difference being the order of arguments) Verbs specify detailed information about sentence structure which is not obviously linked to their meaning, e.g. say versus tell have almost identical meanings, but are used in sentences in very different ways: Say Tell VERB + NOUN PHRASE He said his name X VERB + CLAUSE (mini sentence) He said [that he was hungry] X VERB + NOUN PHRASE + CLAUSE X He told his friend that he was angry These meanings can be \"boiled down\" to a difference in argument structure (or more specifically valency ). The main difference appears to be that say takes 2 arguments, while tell takes 3 arguments. Verbs with very similar meanings have very different argument structure configurations, e.g. He gave a book to Mary / He gave her the book He donated a book to the library / *He donated the library a book If we were just inferring a verb's syntactic behaviour from its meaning, we would have no way to account for this. (NB it's not sure how argument structure can account for this either) Propositions The verb and its arguments from a proposition . A proposition is a mental scene involving at least one participant (or argument) participating in an event or situation (expressed by the verb, or \"predicate\") A proposition contains those entities which make the most important contributions to the truth conditions of the sentence (the real world conditions under which the sentence is true). Nouns (arguments) and verbs make a major contribution to truth conditions, e.g. The dog chased the cat -> The robot washed the cat: TRUTH CONDITIONS HAVE COMPLETELY CHANGED The dog chased the cat -> The dog quickly chased a cat: MINOR CHANGE TO TRUTH CONDITIONS Propositions come at the bottom of a three way heirarchy: Propositional level chase(dog,cat) Sentence level a. The dog chased the cat b. It chased the cat c. The cat was chased by the dog Utterance level A: Is your dog energetic? B: Well, it chases the neighbour's cat every day! We need propositions to explain how different surface forms (e.g. 2) can have the same underlying meaning. The proposition IS the underlying meaning. Thematic relations (roles) Researchers have proposed that the roles given by verbs are universal (i.e. found across languages), and finite (i.e. there are a small set of them). Main roles for Noun Phrases The main roles for Noun Phrases are AGENT , PATIENT , EXPERIENCER and THEME Test AGENT PATIENT EXPERIENCER THEME Does entity deliberately initate the action? Can we say 'what X did was Y...' Yes No No No Is entity affected? Cann we say 'what happend to X was...' Yes Yes No Is entity affected physically? Yes No NB this table should be read as a decision tree. Try to determine the thematic relations of the Noun Phrases in the following sentences: Charles crashed the car Mavis heard the noise The noise startled Mavis The tree fell down in the storm Ali considered the exciting proposal Fatimah hated the start of term The swing broke under his weight The doctor felt the patient's foot I like having a bath with my clothes on Jack liked Susan's holiday snaps on Facebook. Other roles for Noun Phrases Benefactive is the role typically given to Indirect Object Noun Phrases, e.g. She gave $[$ him $ {BEN.}$ $]$ $[$ a book $ {PAT.}$ $]$ She bought $[$ a book $ {PAT.}$ $]$ $[$ for him $ {BEN.}$ $]$ Possessor is the owner of something $[$ Jack $_{POSS.}$ $]$ has/owns a Ferrari The house belongs to $[$ Martha $_{POSS.}$ $]$ Roles for other types of phrases Attributives Phrases which describe a property of something else are called ATTRIBUTIVES, e.g. Janice feels happy $_{ATTR}$ Losing at bingo makes Martha sad $_{ATTR}$ Jack is in a mood $_{ATTR}$ We can often make questions about attributives using the question word how , e.g. Q: How does janice feel? A: Happy ATTRIBUTIVES are mapped to Subject and Object Complements (Cs, Co) Locatives Phrases which describe locations are sometimes called LOCATIVES, e.g. Jason is in the park $_{LOC}$ Pat loaded the hay onto the wagon $_{LOC}$ But be careful for a LOCATIVE to be a genuine argument, it has to be selected by the verb. In the following sentences The girls played baseball in the park the phrase in the park is not technically an argument because it is not chosen by the verb. However, researchers and clinicians have a tendency to label these non-arguments as arguments! How completely sloppy! We can make questions about locatives using the question word where , e.g. Q: Where is Jason? A: In the park. Instruments An instrument is an object used to perform and action, e.g. Angela covered the food with a cloth $_{INSTR}$ This is actually a dubious candidate for a genuine thematic relation. If a verb requires a specific instrument, the instrument is often made explicit in the verb, e.g. He hammered the nail (with a hammer) She filed her nails (with a nail file). If a verb does not require a specific instrument, it is expressed using with , e.g. He scratched his back with a loofah This is arguably not an essential participant in the scratching action, and this kind of phrase is always omissible. So it probably shouldn't be categorised as an argumnet (but many people do!)

Here we are using complement in a broader fashion to describe 'ways of completing the sentence'. Under this broader definition, direct and indirect objects can also be described as complements Complements versus Modifying Phrases (a) Complements are \"chosen\" by verbs, or other words/phrases in the sentence. They sentence sounds odd without them. Modifying phrases feel \"added on\". They are optional. There are two types of modifying phrases, Adverials, and Postmodifiers (see below). Complements of the verb All post-verbal arguments can be described as complements of the verb. These are Od, Oi, Co, Cs. So far, we have only looked at phrasal complements, e.g. Noun Phrases, Adjective Phrases, or Prepositional Phrases. Amy dropped [ the pen $_{NP}$ ] Jack painted $[$ the roof $ {NP}$ $]$ $[$ bright red $ {Adj.}$ $]$ Jack smashed $[$ the vase $ {NP}$ $]$ $[$ into pieces $ {Prep.~Phrase}$ $]$ Verbs can also specify clausal complements (i.e. mini sentences) Jack said [ that he was hungry $_{Clause}$ ] Magda alleged $[$ that Carter was seeing another woman $_{Clause~(with~\"that\")}$ $]$ Angie told $[$ Mel $ {NP}$ $]$ $[$ that she was seeing another woman $ {Clause~(with~\"that\")}$ $]$ When a clause is used a complement it takes on the same function as the equivalent Noun Phrase, e.g. Angie told $[$ Mel $ {NP~=~ Oi}$ $]$ $[$ something $ {Od}$ $]$ Angie told $[$ Mel $ {NP~=~ Oi}$ $]$ $[$ that she was seeing another woman $ {Clause~=~Od}$ $]$ Complements of other words Complements of Adjectives Jack is afraid [ of pigeons $_{PP}$ ] Jack is afraid [ for his friend $_{PP}$ ] Jack is afraid [ that pigeons will get him $_{Clause~(with~\"that\")}$ ] Annie is surprised [ by Greg's behaviour $_{PP}$ ] Annie is surprised [ at Greg's behaviour $_{PP}$ ] Annie is surprised [ that Greg came late $_{Clause~(with~\"that\")}$ ] Mei Lin is disappointed [ by the news $_{PP}$ ] Mei Lin is disappointed [ about the news $_{PP}$ ] Mei Lin is disappointed [ that Greg came late $_{Clause~(with~\"that\")}$ ] Complements of Nouns Donna's belief [ in fairies $_{PP}$ ] is amusing Anna's fear [ of lamp posts $_{PP}$ ] is puzzling The destruction [ of the temple $_{PP}$ ] shocked the tribes of Israel A recap on terminology Phrases = Groups of words which behave as a whole . We can do tests for phrases, e.g. can you question them or substitute them? Functions = A label to describe the syntactic role which phrases play in a sentence. NB though certain functions tend to have certain semantic roles , functions are primarily syntactic , e.g. The sweets were given to all those with perfect marks The sweets is the Direct Object of the \"underlying\" sentence, e.g. she gave the sweets to the child . However, here the sweets has been moved into Subject position, and is therefore a subject . Note that it has the formal syntactic properties of a Subject, namely subject-verb agreement ( the sweets ~~are~~ / were ), and nominative case-marking when the Noun Phrase is replaced by a pronoun ( they / ~~them~~ were given to all those with perfect marks ) Argument = Essential Participants in the event described by the verb. The arguments are chosen by the verbs. The verb also specifies the role fo the arguments, and their order. Complement (narrow definition) = Word to describe a post-verbal argument which serves to modify either the Subject or Object. Complement (broader definition) = A phrase which \"completes\" the sentence. It is chosen by a particular word, and comes after that word. Postverbal arguments (e.g. Od, Oi, Co, Ci) can be described as complements of the verb. However, other word classes can have complements, e.g. Adjectives and Nouns. Complements versus Modifiers (b) Adverbials and Post-modifiers As mentioned, there are two modifying functions: Adverbials and Postmodifiers. While Adverbials tend to modify the entire sentence, Postmodifiers modify the preceding Noun Phrase. $[$ Next Tuesday $ {Adverbial}$ $]$ we'll sell our house $[$ with any luck $ {Adverbial}$ $]$ The house $[$ at the end of the street $_{PP~acting~as~Post-Modifer}$ $]$ was for sale The house $[$ that was at the end of the street $_{Clause~acting~as~Post-Modifer}$ $]$ was for sale Both types of modifying phrases are optional. Adverbials are also moveable, and are able to occur at either peripheral position (the very beginning or very end of the sentence). Focus on adverbials Adverbials and adverbs refer to almost the same thing Adverb = a single word which tends to sit in the verb complex and modfies the verb, e.g. She $[$ quickly ran $_{Verb~Complex}$ $]$ to the shops Adverbial = a phrase (often containing multiple words) which sits at the sentence periphery, and modifies the entire sentence, e.g. $[$ Next Tuesday $ {Adverbial}$ $]$ we'll sell our house $[$ with any luck $ {Adverbial}$ $]$ Adverbials have a variety of functions. They can be used to express manner, place, or time, e.g. MANNER: She walks [ with a slight limp ] PLACE: She plays cricket [ in the park ] TIME: [ On Tuesday ] she sold the house The can also express a variety of discourse functions, e.g. CHANGING TOPIC: [ Anway ], have you heard the news about Ruth? EXPRESSING LOGICAL RELATIONSHIPS: [ However ], she still couldn't lift heavy weights. (NB the sentence CONTRADICTS information in the preceding discourse, e.g. She trained hard. However she still couldn't lift heavy weights ). EXPRESSING AN OPINION: [ In my opinion ] we should treat syntactic difficulties using recasts Focus on Post-modifiers Can be either a Prepositional Phrase or a clause: The man [ with the hat $_{PP}$ ] lost his wallet The man [ who was wearing a hat $_{Clause}$ ] lost his wallet The man [ ~~who was~~ wearing a hat $_{Reduced~clause}$ ] lost his wallet Distinguishing between complements and modifiers While complements \"snuggle up\" to the word that specifies them, modifiers can be separated from that word; The teacher $[$ of mathematics $ {PP}$ $]$ $[$ with red hair $ {PP}$ $]$ just won the lottery *The teacher $[$ with red hair $ {PP}$ $]$ $[$ of mathematics $ {PP}$ $]$ just won the lottery Jeanine filled the car $[$ with petrol $ {PP}$ $]$ $[$ on Tuesday $ {PP}$ $]$ *Jeanine filled the car $[$ on Tuesday $ {PP}$ $]$ $[$ with petrol $ {PP}$ $]$ Jack is proud $[$ of his achievements $ {PP}$ $]$ $[$ with good reason $ {PP}$ $]$ *Jack is proud $[$ with good reason $ {PP}$ $]$ $[$ of his achievements $ {PP}$ $]$ Complements and lexical representation Are complements predictable from meaning? How do we know which type of complement to use after a verb, adjective or noun? To a certain extent complement types are predictable from the meaning of the verb, noun, or adjective. For example, we tend to use clausal complements with mental state verbs because clauses describe imaginary scenes or situations which we are able to think about. I hope [ that you won't miss the train ] I imagine [ that he was very angry ] I believe [ that he's in a relationship ] However, complements are not wholly predictable from meaning. Why are we surprised by something, but delighted with something? Admire and like have very similar meanings (a positive emotion about someone) but they differ very much in their syntactic behaviour: I like $[\u200b$ that you don't get down about stuff $_{that~plus~clause}\u200b$ $]\u200b$ ?? I admire $[$ that you don't get down about stuff $_{that~plus~clause}$ $]$ The answer is that the word specifies its own syntactic behaviour. The lemma (and the lexeme) We were introduced to the \"lemma\" at the end of Week 3. This is a level where word-mearnings are stored. By contrast, word-forms are stored at a later level, the \"lexeme\" level. Evidence for the separation of the \"lemma\" and \"lexeme\" levels comes from tip-of-the-tongue phenomena, and phonological substitutions. The lemma also contains the complement-selection properties of a word. This helps us to use the word in a sentence, e.g. by determining the structure of the sentence after the word. Perhaps the strongest motivation for the lemma comes from languages where nouns have genders, e.g. masculine and feminine, e.g. French, Italian, Spanish. Data from patient \"Dante\" (Badecker et al. 1995), an individual with aphasia, suggests that the ability to report the gender of a word, is independent of the ability to name that word. This suggests the separation of the lemma and the lexeme. Roughly-speaking the lemma contains modality-general information about a word, while the lexeme contains modality-specific information.

Conclusions: The sentence frame is appropriate but the words are in the wrong position. Therefore, it looks as if the sentence frame has been chosen before the words have been inserted The voicing on maniacs is consistent with the previous consonant. Therefore the voicing rule has been applied after the word swap has taken place. Combining these two observations, we have evidence for 3 stages: (1) a stage which involves the selection of the frame (2) a stage which involves the insertion of words (3) a phonetic stage where the phonetic realisation of affixes is determined. Models of sentence production These all start with an abstract plan of what we're going to say, and finish with a precise articulated form. The dominant models were proposed by Garrett (1975) and Levelt (1989). Garrett proposes 5 stages Message level - Very abstract representation of what we are going to say Functional level - Activations of relevant lemmas. Still no syntactic frame Positional level - Syntactic frame chosen, insertion of invariant lexemes/morphemes Phonetic level - Insertion of variant lexemes/morphemes and syllabification Articulatory level - Speech motor programme assembled. Levelt proposes a more course-grained hierarchy Conceptual level (corresponding to Garrett's message level) Formulation level (corresponding to Garrett's Function, Positional, and Phonetic levels) Articulation level (corresponding to Garrett's Articulatory level) 1. The message level 1a. What information is represented at the message level? A mental representation of the thoughts we wish to put into words. We know what entities we wish to talk about, and what kind of situation or event they are participating in. We must encode relational information , e.g. what is the relationship between an entity and an action? Is that entity the AGENT of the action, or the PATIENT of the action. At a later stage, the entities will be mapped onto arguments , while the situation/event will be mapped onto the verb . In addition, to specifying entities and situations we take a particular perspective on the action. For example, we to decide which entity to focus on. Typically, the thing were are focusing on will come in non-subject position, will be specified with a full Noun Phrase (as opposed to a pronoun), and will take stress, e.g. I saw a strange man in the street. $[$ He $ {TOPIC}$ $]$ was wearing $[$ the weirdest clothes I've ever seen $ {FOCUS}$ $]$. We must also decide when the event took place (which will be expressed via tense ), and how we wish to focus on the verb, e.g. do we wish to be inside the event, or outside the event. This is expressed as grammatical aspect . John has chopped the carrot = PERFECTIVE aspect for completed event John is chopping the carrot = PROGRESSIVE aspect for ongoing event 1b. How do we get from the Message level to the Functional level? We retrieve (a) the lemmas (b) the argument structure We assign thematic thematic relations 2. Functional level 2a. What information is represented at the functional level? Consists of semantic information : arguments with correct roles Focusing information (e.g. which arguments to focus on, or how we are going to focus on the verb) may also be represented at this level There is no syntactic informatio n, e.g. how we are going to order the words in a sentence. 2b. How do we get from the Functional level to the Positional level? We retrieve (a) the lexemes (b) the syntactic frame We link or map the arguments to their correct position in the frame. The syntactic planning frame consists of (a) closed class morphemes, and (b) slots/placeholders for open class morphemes, e.g. [DET] \u2026\u2026.. [AUX-be] \u2026\u2026... [+prog].[DET] \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 [PREP].[DET] \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026... ( dative , e.g. the woman is giving the flowers to the boy ) [DET] \u2026\u2026.. [AUX-be] \u2026\u2026... [+perf].[PREP].[DET] \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. (passive , e.g. the cat was chased by the dog ) [DET] \u2026\u2026... \u2026\u2026...\u2026[+past].[DET]\u2026\u2026.... [PREP].[DET]\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.... ( locative , e.g. the dog chased the cat up the tree ) The linking problem How do we ensure that right arguments get assigned to the right surface position? Jackendoff (1990) proposes a thematic hierarchy. We align arguments in a specific order based on their roles (e.g. AGENT > PATIENT > RECIPIENT) We then assign these arguments to slots in the frame on a one-by-one basis. But note this won't always give the right results, e.g. The man$ {AG.}$ gave the woman$ {REC.}$ the present$_{PAT.}$ Errors in children Have a look at these errors in children. How have they arisen? Can I fill some salt into the bear? I'm going to cover a screen over me. (Bowerman, 1982) The lady is filling the sweets into the jar. The lady is covering the scarf on her head. (Ebbels, 2007) 3. Positional level 3a. What information is represented at the Positional level? Now we have syntactic information! We represent the sentence frame , and lexemes which are phonetically invariant (i.e. their pronunciation is similar whatever context they occur in) 3b. How do we get from the Positional level to the Phonetic level? We retreive (a) segments, and (b) metrical structure We assemble a phonological sequence (consisting of segments, combined with metrical structure). Evidence that segments and metrical structure are stored separately: Stress shift - to ensure that stressed syllables do not come close to each other. She's fif- teen / I saw fif -teen men . Five o' clock in the after- noon / We had after -noon tea . It was ca-ta- stroph -ic / It was a ca -ta-strophic fai lure Evidence from aphasia (Nickels & Howard, 1999) Aphasic individuals often produce phonemes in correct order, but not correct stress pattern Are much better at naming items with more frequent stress patterns 4. Phonetic level 4a. What is represented at the phonetic level? A phonological sequence consisting of segments, and information related to metrical structure (e.g. word stress). Phonetically-variant lexemes/phonemes are realised at this level, e.g. DETERMINER: A book / A n elephant DETERMINER: Th e man / Th e essay (tongue is retracted for second) PARTICLE: I want t o eat / I want t o drink (second is longer and involves more lip rounding) A number of errors may occur at this level including Swapping errors, e.g. cherry tart -> terry chart Anticipation errors, e.g. terry tart -> terry chart Perseveration errors, e.g. cherry tart -> cherry chart NB these errors respect syllabic position, so perhaps they occur later at the syllable retrieval stage? 4b. How do we get from the Phonetic level to the Articulatory level? We retrieve syllables, along with their articulation plans. We assemble motor instructions. Motivation for syllables as units of representation Liaison, e.g. why are you said -> wai - j - a: -ju: - sad Resyllabification (where a segment from one word/morpheme occurs in a syllable with segments from another word/morpheme) A versus An - /n/ is resyllabified Last^h^ hour - aspiration phenomena suggest that /t/ has been rsyllabified (as aspiration only occurs syllable-initially) Bibliography Bowerman, M.

Here it takes an object ( the napkin ), and a Prepositional Phrase expressing location ( off the table ). This is a very unusual use of sneeze . However, the meaning is transparent, that our sneeze propells the napkin off the table. The question is how are we able to comprehenend and produce such an utterance? Traditional verb-centric story: we access the verb, then retrieve the argument structure from the lemma. PROBLEM: sneeze is unlikely to specify an argument structure with 3 entities. It is theoretically possible that we have a special meaning of sneeze in our lexicons, e.g. sneeze = make a sudden involuntary expulsion of air from the nose and mouth due to irritation of one's nostrils such that the resulting air flow propels an object X from location Y . But this is unlikely given the rarity of sentences with sneeze and three arguments. The meaning of the sentence comes, in part, form the sentence frame or 'construction'. The construction NP$_1$ + V + NP$_2$ + PP means NP$_1$ acts upon NP$_2$ such that NP$_2$ changes location . The verb is then 'squished' into the construction, and the two meanings (verb + construction) are 'fused' By assuming that constructions have meaning, we can overcome a lot of problems with traditional Verb Argument Structure accounts. Problems with traditional Verb Argument Structure accounts 1. Valency augmentation We often use sentences with more arguments than the standard valency, e.g. She sneezed the napkin off the table (example above) The naughty students laughed the teacher out of the room She juggled her way to the semi-finals of the juggling contest Can you chop me some carrots? Quote me happy! (Recent advert for insurance) 2. Weird thematic relations There are plenty of verbs which take arguments with 'weird' roles, e.e.g She is happy The table needs a leg That coat suits you The coat fits me She swapped her Porsche for a Ferrari Both a Porsche and a Ferrari can be described as PATIENTS, but this undermines the principle that there is differentiation between the arguments They loaded the truck with hay Is truck a LOCATIVE or a PATIENT? If it is a PATIENT what kind of role does hay play? (assuming that all roles need to be differentiated?) None of these roles can be easily described using standard labels. There is no list of thematic relations which can account for all arguments in English, or indeed any language. This is despite many dozens of attempts by linguists. How constructions solve these issues Goldberg's theory of Verb Argument Structure Constructions Goldberg (1995) proposes that when we use verbs in setnences, we insert them into Verb Argument Structure Constructions (VAS Constructions). These are syntactic units with their own independent meaning . This can help explain both valency augmentation and weird thematic relations : Valency augmentation Here are the two possible solutions: The multiple sense account. We have different senses of verbs in our lexicons, some of which allow extra arguments. e.g. there is a lexical entry for sneeze which allows for three arguments The construction based account. The extra argument is specified by the construction itself. The multiple sense account is highly implausible. Given how rare it is to use sneeze with three arguments, it is very unlikely that we have such a representation in the lexicon. Weird thematic relations If roles are (in part) given by the construction itself, we are not committed to a small and finite set of roles. For example we could posit the following constructions: The copula construction: FORM: X is Y FUNCTION 1: X denotes the same referent as Y (e.g. One man's terrorist is another man's Freedom Fighter) FUNCTION 2: Y describes a property of X (e.g. Die hard is a great Xmas film) FUNCTION 3 (where X and Y are identical): X/Y has a property which is relevant to the current discussion (e.g. It wasn't a great film, but hey, George Clooney is George Clooney) The \"needing\" construction: FORM: X + needing verb + Y FUNCTION: X needs Y (e.g. we're going to need a bigger boat, this task requires a bigger boat, this task necessitates a bigger boat) The fit/suit construction: FORM: X + fit/suit + Y. FUNCTION: X (an item of clothing) looks good on Y (a person) How constructions combine with verbs Fusion But surely the verbs must provide a role as well? Yes, verbs specify roles which are highly specific to that verb , while the VAS Construction specifies roles which are more general . When using a verb with a particular VAS Construction, we need to \"fuse\" the verb-specific role in the former, with the more general role in the latter. What about traditional roles, e.g. \"AGENT\" / \"PATIENT\"? Many of the roles specified by VAS Constructions correspond to widely used traditional labels such as \"AGENT\" and \"PATIENT\", but many do not (e.g. the subject of the copula, or the subject of need ). Some roles appear to be more general than others because they Occur in VAS Constructions with very general/abstract meanings and which allow lots of different verbs, e.g. AGENT + VERB + PATIENT Describe slots with similar meanings in related constructions, e.g. THEME + VERB + EXP. = She scares me, They please George, The play entertained me EXP. + VERB + THEME = I fear her, George likes them, I enjoyed the play The implications of VAS constructions The idea of VAS constructions contradicts with traditional \"words and rules\" approaches to grammar. According to these approaches, words are combined using rules, and then are semantically interpreted, e.g. RULE: VP <- V + NP RULE: Sentence <- NP + VP INTERPRETATION: A situation involving two NPs whose roles are determined by the verb. Late semantic interpretation can be explained by the fact that we always try to identify a meaning as long as the sentence is well formed, e.g. Colourless green ideas sleep furiously Words and rules approaches draw a categorical distinction between syntax (combinatorial rules) and the lexicon (repository of meaning) However, according to Goldberg, syntactic constructions can also be meaningful. This breaks down the distinction between syntax and the lexicon. According to Goldberg, they are all part of the same system. Words involve mapping between form and meaning. Constructions also involve a mapping between form and meaning. Other types of construction (not VAS) Multi-word constructions are everywhere, e.g. You mean, I've got Arthritis Arthritis!!?? FORM: The noun is repeated. MEANING: There is a scale of authenticity ranging from N to N + N (Arthritis to Arthritis Arthritis). N + N (Arthritis Arthritis) is at the high end of this scale. There are burgers, and then there are burgers FORM: There is/are + NP and then there is/are + NP MEANING: There is a scale of authenticity , with the second NP at the top of the scale. Now watch me go and drop this cake! FORM: Now watch + Clause (with nonfinite verb) MEANING: Sometimes called the \" tempting fate \" construction. It means I hope X DOESN'T happen, e.g. I hope I DON'T drop this cake. She worked her way to the top of the class FORM: Subject + Verb + Possessive determiner (his, her, its) + \"way\" + PREPOSITIONAL PHRASE MEANING: X arrived at location Z by means of action Y. Progress is difficult , and the path is circuitous These all display correspondences between form and meaning. The meanings are not predictable from general linguistic rules, i.e. they are non-compositional. Comparing the two models According to the Words and Rules Approach There is a categorical distinction between words (meaning) and rules (form) Linguistic knowledge consists of (a) lexical knowledge, and (b) syntactic knowledge (ability to combine words) Semantic interpretation of a sentence is seperate (and subsequent to) syntactic interpretation According to Construction Grammar accounts Words and syntactic constructions are all part of the same system , sometimes called the \"Constructicon\" Linguistic knowledge = knowledge of constructions (words can be described as \"minimal constructions\") Semantics and syntax are inseparable (as syntactic constructions are meaningful) Problems for construction grammar Some syntactic phenomena do not appear to be linked to meaning, e.g. subject + verb agreement. Clinical implications When teaching children grammatical constructions we need to higlight the meaning of those constructions. E.g. Riches (2013) highlights the meaning of the passive construction (the verb is highly affected), e.g. The vase was smashed by the dog (Vase is highly affected) This is reflected in children's early use of the passive. We very rarely have passives in which the subject is not highly affected, e.g. It was dreamt about. Bibliography Goldberg, A. E. (1995).
