This effect is called the \u201ctesting effect\u201d, and a learning strategy which depends on continually testing yourself is called \u201ctest-enhanced\u201d learning. Amazingly, there is good evidence that the very act of testing yourself is beneficial, even if you do not successfully recall the relevant information (Kornell et al., 2015; Kornell & Vaughn, 2016; Vaughn et al., 2017). This is pretty extraordinary and suggests that time spent studying at your desk is never wasted, even if you are struggling to recall the material. The way that you test yourself depends on the material you are learning. For example, if testing new words in a foreign language you could have a card with the word in your first language (e.g. English) on one side, and the word in the target language (e.g. French) on the other side. You can work your way through the pack, read the English word, try to recall the French word, and test your knowledge by turning over the card. You could also do this process in reverse, e.g. look at the French word, and try to translate this into English. The more active we are in the way we test ourselves, the better we learn and retain the information. Regarding the flashcard example above, the more active form of learning is to read the English word, and try to recall the French word. However, though the alternative process, translating from French to English is less active, it may be beneficial in certain contexts, e.g. for quick revision. Some forms of learning are much more abstract not amenable to flashcards. An example of this is your understanding of the word class Noun. You could revise this in a variety of ways, e.g. - Provide a definition , but with a word missing, e.g. A Noun is word which often refers to a ___ (thing). It is often preceded by a ___ (Determiner) - Create a multiple choice question , e.g. In the following sentence, which of the following properties does not describe a Noun It takes the suffix -ing \u2714 It takes the suffix -s (in the regular form) It is often prceded by a detrminer - Create an open-ended \u201clist\u201d question , e.g. \u201cList three properties of a Noun\u201d (Possible answers: it tends to refer to a thing, it inflects for plural, e.g. horses , it comes after a determiner, e.g. the horse , it \u201cagrees\u201d with a verb, e.g. the horse runs, the horses run_ etc.) - Create a completely open-ended question , e.g. \u201cWhat is a definition of a noun\u201d? Which of these you think promotes more active learning? Evidence suggests that the more open-ended questions lead to better learning because they involve active recall of the material rather than recognition of the right answer (Kang et al., 2007). This doesn\u2019t mean that multiple-choice questions are bad for study \u2013 they can be very beneficial. For example, there are clear right or wrong answers, unlike open-ended questions, and this can help you decide whether you need to revise a particular topic. They are also less time-consuming than open-ended questions. A good revision strategy would probably contain a mix of different types of revision prompts, e.g. flashcards, multiple-choice questions, open-ended list questions, and completely open-ended questions. Why note-taking is a key skill \u00b6 Words are concrete and easy to test using flashcard systems. For other kinds of knowledge, e.g. abstract theories, flashcards are too crude and simplistic, so you\u2019ll need to find other ways to test yourself. For example, you could write the key claims of the theory on a piece of paper, number these, and using the numbers as prompts try to recall each claim one by one. This kind of works, but it is clear that the more abstract and complex a knowledge domain becomes, the more difficult it is to think of ways to test yourself. While you are thinking about clever procedures to test yourself on everything you need to know, just start taking some notes. Take a blank sheet of paper, or open up a note-taking app, and try to recall everything you need to know in note form. By taking notes you are having to actively recall and process the information you have learnt. For example, because you are incapable of rapidly writing down everything the lecturer says (unless you are a word-record typist or short-hand expert), you are having to identify the most important points when notetaking. Also, because human memory for linguistic form is generally weaker than our memory for linguistic meaning, you will have to write down the main points of the lecture in your own words, and in this way you are having to actively process the information. An additional benefit of note-taking is that you can easily show the structure of the material you are learning using headings and subheadings. All of the material you learn will have some kind of structure, e.g. a theory might consist of three key arguments, and the ICF clinical framework consists of four areas of functioning. Lectures themselves will be organised into discrete sections. Moreover, there is evidence to suggest that information is more adequately processed and retained when it is explicitly integrated into a larger structure. For example the regular use of headings and subheadings in written passages helps the reader to read more quickly and accurately, and recall more information (Hy\u00f6n\u00e4 & Lorch, 2004; Lorch & Lorch, 1996; Sanchez et al., 2001). However, while the information you are given fits into an overarching structure, the technology which is used to deliver lectures is not great for showing structure. Powerpoint does not show structure very well, as it invites the user to create a continuous chain of slides. Sometimes lecturers add \u201cTable of Contents\u201d slides, but this is not that widely practised. By making notes you can actually impose structure on the material you are learning, using headings and subheadings, and this will help you to learn that material. The Cornell note-taking system \u00b6 A good tried and tested note-taking system is called \u201cCornell Notes\u201d, which was devised by Prof. Walter Pauk of Cornell University in the 1950s. If you do an internet search you will find loads of materials on this approach. Here is one link to start you off. Why writing notes on slides may not be helpful \u00b6 Lecturers often supply their students with handouts containing the slides. Many students write on these handouts, and believe that this is an appropriate way to learn. But what is the evidence that this is a good learning approach? Existing studies investigating the impact of slide-based handouts have found that students learn better without them (Kim, 2018; Worthington & Levasseur, 2015). Why might this be the case? Firstly, if the slides contain a substantial amount of text, you are less likely to convert what you have learnt into your own words. Your notes will become shorter. They will become comments on the slides, rather than a full paraphrase of what you have just heard. Consequently, you will be learning in a more passive manner. Secondly, as mentioned above, it is quite difficult to signpost structure within slides. By contrast, if you make notes on a blank piece of paper it is easier to show structure by writing your own subheadings. So, I just need to make good notes? \u00b6 Yes, good note-taking is the place to start, but you also need to explore other ways to test yourself. As mentioned, flashcards may be very useful. For example, for anatomy, you could have a picture of a part of the body on one side, and the label on the other. You can look at the picture, and then attempt to recall the label. If you are correct, put it in the correct pile, and if you are incorrect, or cannot recall it, put it in the incorrect pile. There is quite interesting evidence to suggest that if you correctly recall something once, you are likely to recall it successfully in the future (Bahrick et al., 1993). Therefore, you can learn very efficiently just by repeatedly testing yourself on the items in the incorrect pile. Also, make sure that, when you test yourself, you do it at fairly widely-spaced intervals. This principle is known as \u201cdistributed learning\u201d or the \u201cspacing effect\u201d, and there is a lot of evidence that it is beneficial for learning in an academic setting (Dempster, 1988). Naturally, flashcards are only amenable to certain kinds of topics. For more abstract topics (e.g. Linguistics, Psychology), and you will need to find other ways to test yourself, e.g. by creating your own questions / prompts. What to do with all this technology? \u00b6 There is a whole host of technology out there for you to explore when it comes to taking notes, or creating flashcards. Below I have described a few apps that I am aware of, but there must be many more out there that I\u2019ve missed; Note-taking \u00b6 OneNote \u2013 this has the advantage that it integrates well with other Microsoft products, e.g. emailing, calendar, and Teams Notion (https://www.notion.so) \u2013 possibly the most widely used non-Microsoft note-taking app. It\u2019s also great as a general organisational app. Its basic plan is free. Roam Research (https://roamresearch.com) \u2013 High-concept, and slightly geeky app, frequently touted as \u201cthe next big thing\u201d. It\u2019s online only, and expensive, but students can get free plans. Evernote (https://evernote.com) \u2013 Simple app, which works both online and locally Apple Notes - If you are an Apple afficionado. Flashcards \u00b6 Quizlet (https://quizlet.com/en-gb) \u2013 online flashcard app. Anki (https://apps.ankiweb.net) \u2013 open source cross-platform flashcard app. It has a bit of a steep learning curve. All-in-one technologies \u00b6 These are technologies which incorporate note-taking and flashcards in a single app. The idea is that you can use them to take notes, and quickly generate flashcards to test yourself. Remnote (https://www.remnote.com) \u2013 Very user-friendly, online but also with a local app. It is explicitly designed for students. However, make sure you regularly back up your data to your local computer and don\u2019t leave it sitting in the cloud (Remnote provides an easy way to do this). Obsidian - (https://obsidian.md) - Very popular note-taking app with revision features incorporated via plugins. Logseq (https://logseq.com) \u2013 Wonderful open-source notetaking and general organisational app. However, the learning curve is steeper than remnote. A big advantage is that you have complete ownership of your data. Roam Research \u2013 As mentioned above. Roam also has good tools for creating question banks. Further reading \u00b6 \u201cMake it stick: the science of succesful learning\u201d (Brown, Roediger III, McDaniel) is a popular science book written by leading experts in the field which covers many of the above ideas, e.g. test-enhanced learning, distributed practice. The website which accompanies the book (https://www.retrievalpractice.org/make-it-stick) also contains lots of really cool infographics to demonstrate the main ideas. Check it out!

Interpretation 'no thanks' is only derivable if sentence is produced in the appropriate context What is phonology? \u00b6 Ask Ghada and Jalal!! Crossing over \u00b6 While it is tempting to think in neat subfields, many phenomena cross over e.g. The meaning of verbs (semantics) determines the number of participants in a sentence, which in turn determines the structure (syntax). John [1] gave Mary [2] a book [3] Because of these cross-over phenomena, linguists often talk about the 'interfaces' between the different subdomains, e.g. the syntax-semantic interface. Subfields of linguistics \u00b6 Theoretical linguistics : investigates the nature of linguistic knowledge. IMPORTANT QUESTIONS: Are we born with knowledge of language? How do we explain similarities and differences across languages? Psycholinguistics : investigates how we comprehend and produce language. IMPORTANT QUESTIONS: Is the human mind similar to desktop computer? Does the language we speak affect the way we think? Sociolinguistics : investigates how and why language varies across different social classes and groupings. E.g. William Labov's famous (1963) study of Martha's Vinyard. He studies centralisation of diphthongs (multi-sound vowels). He pioneered methods to elicit relevant words without using word lists. He found an association between self-identification as a native and use of centralisation. Centralisation increased in response to an influx of non-natives. This shows that the language we use \"indexes\" our social identity. Discourse studies : How we use language to persuade / exert power relationships. Approaches to language structure \u00b6 Prescriptive grammars - how we SHOULD speak \u00b6 Prescriptive judgements regarding language usage are periodically proposed by influential individuals. Key targets of prescriptive judgements are the double negative and use of innit as a tage question. Linguists would not regard either of these forms as \"bad\" English. The key thing is that they are (a) shared among a speech community (b) adequately convey a message, i.e. do not lead to ambiguity and misunderstanding. (1) Double negative : I haven't got no money / I can't get no satisfaction Acceptable in certain dialects (e.g. London English) and languages (e.g. Spanish). It does not cause confusion as many prescriptivists claim. (2) Use of innit as a tag question It was a great meal, wasn't it / innit ? You're Jack's nephew, aren't you / innit ? They've been to Greece, haven't they / innit? This simplifies tag questions, but why is that a bad thing? Many languages create tag questions using single morphemes, e.g. Bengali kanna . (3) African-American Vernacular English : He be working Tuesdays (he is usually working on a Tuesday) He been got a job (he got a job a long time ago) It grammaticalises concepts which are not grammaticalised in Standard English. Therefore it is RICHER (with regard to certain grammatical subsystems). So how do prescriptive grammars arise? They reflect the dominant dialect in the country, which in turn is a consequence of which regions hold the most political and economic power. As Weinreich said 'A language is a dialect with an army and a navy' Descriptive grammars - how we ACTUALLY speak \u00b6 Geordie English: No plural suffix for nouns denoting a time period, e.g. I've been here three year. Scottish English: Use of amn't I ? as a tag question, e.g. I'm next in line, amn't I ? Mental grammars - the underlying system \u00b6 Which of these sentences is correct? Me and Jack went to the shops I and Jack went to the shops Jack and me went to the shops Jack and I went to the shops Now which is the way you actually say the sentence? Note that there is a conflict between prescriptive and mental grammars. Individuals who allow prescriptive grammars to override mental grammars are guilty of 'hypercorrection' Hypercorrection \u00b6 This is a phenomena whereby we override our mental grammar, and instead adopt a prescriptive grammar. Our natural tendency is to say Me and Jack went to the shops . This is our mental grammar . However, in certain formal contexts, we may say Jack and I went to the shops , which is often prescribed at school. Hypercorrection is interesting because it shows that prescriptive grammar has a lot of power over us. A communicative view of language \u00b6 Definition \u00b6 (1) Language is primarily a form a communication and all linguistic 'rules' subserve this goal (2) Linguistic 'rules' are established by speech communities (3) A sentence is 'well-formed' if it reliably expresses the speaker's thoughts using forms which are 'conventionalised', i.e. shared by the speaker's speech community. Relationship with SLT practice \u00b6 When assessing children we should evaluate their language according to the norms of their speech community For example, deviations from the target when scoring sentence repetition which are consistent with the speaker's dialect are not scored as an error. \"The Influence of Linguistic Bias Upon Speech-Language Pathologists\u2019 Attitudes Toward Clinical Scenarios Involving Nonstandard Dialects of English\", Easton and Verdon, 2020 Therapists were given dialect-related clinical scenarios, and needed to make clinical judgements Length of experience was correlated with more careful clinical judgements Positive attitudes to dialect difference were correlated with more careful clinical judgements. 5-minute exercise \u00b6 What is the grammatical word class (e.g. noun, verb, adjective etc.) of the italicised words in the following sentences: The raging river tore through the valley That film really sucks","title":"01 - Introduction"},{"location":"lecture%20notes/01%20-%20introduction/#01-introduction","text":"","title":"01 - Introduction"},{"location":"lecture%20notes/01%20-%20introduction/#introduction","text":"","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"lecture%20notes/01%20-%20introduction/#why-slts-need-to-know-about-linguistics","text":"Is a child who says Him go there language impaired?

How/why have they occured? They misunderestimated me They can refudiate what this group is saying I'm on my way to the lection I don't expose anyone will eat that These errors are known as 'blends'. Two words are activated, and combined into one, e.g. expect + suppose -> expose / misunderstand + underestimate -> misunderestimate . Note that when this happens there is often a phonological 'pivot' (my terminology) in the middle of word, i.e. material shared across both words. For exampel, the p in expect / suppose Characteristics: (1) Multiple Semantic Activation: overlapping meanings (2) Phonological processes in selection: similar word-internal phonology. Process by which blends are formed combines opportunistic activation / assembly with rigorous monitoring What does it tell us about words? They are stored in semantic and networks (activation of multiple words with overlapping meanings). There is activation across domains : semantic activation of multiple competitors, and phonological processes involved in blending (the use of a 'pivot'). The system biases speed over accuracy , but recovers from error due to a monitoring system . Meaning-related sense-relationships \u00b6 Hyponymy \u00b6 'Hypo' = under, 'nym' = word Plant > Tree > Sycamore / Plant > Flower > Daisy / Furniture > Chair > Stool A subset relationship. As you go upwards, extension (potential referents) expands, intension (list of definitional properties) narrows. Tree is a hyponym / subordinate of Plant Plant is a hyperonym / superordinate of Tree Mid-level categories are (a) more rapidly named, (b) more easily visualised, (c) acquired earlier Words which exist at the same level are called co-hyponyms or coordinates , e.g. daisy, begonia, Tulip / flower, bush, tree / chair, sofa, wardrobe. Synonmy \u00b6 'Syn' = together, 'nym' = name/word Words with identical meanings. Very few genuine synonyms. When words are identical in denotation (event or thing they refer to), they differ in connotation (set of associations they trigger), e.g. chap / bloke / geezer (who would you buy a used car from?) , fiesta / knees up / bash / soir\u00e9e (which would you prefer to go to?) There are very few genuine synonyms, i.e. where denotation and connotation are teh same. Some examples are words differing across dialects or varieties of a language, e.g. tap / fawcett, pavement / sidewalk , and some grammatical words, e.g. however / nonetheless Antonmy \u00b6 'Anto' = opposite, 'nym' = name/word Words with opposite meanings. Can be gradable (e.g. slightly hot , very cold ) or non-gradable (e.g. * very dead ) Sometimes there is no obvious opposite, e.g. the opposite of virgin . There is a 'lexical gap' Homonymy \u00b6 'Homo' = same, 'nym' = name/word. Same form, but no obvious meaning relationship. Words have similar forms due to ' historical accident '. May have same root (in which case there is a tenuous meaning relationship), e.g. a table of numbers, versus the kitchen table Or may have a different root, e.g. bay tree [LATIN baca], the ship entered the bay [OLD FRENCH baie], the dogs bayed [OLD FRENCH abai]. The fact that these words, with different an unrelated meanings, have the same pronunciation is a historical accident. Polysemy \u00b6 'Poly' = multiple, 'sem' = meaning. Same form, and different but related meanings. The meaning relationship is mentally represented Prepositions are notoriously polysemous, e.g. over = straight movement in contact with a plane, e.g. he ran over the field , or over = two dimensional movement across a bounded plane, e.g. the balloon floated over the city (or possibly there is no movement at all), or over = random movement covering a plane_, e.g. he poured ketchup over the chips_. Other polysemous words; He went to bed , a river- bed , flower bed , the steak was served on a bed of lettuce The cup was full , the room was full , she has a full schedule, she leads a full life. Are meaning relationships systematic or random? According to Charles Fillmore (e.g. Fillmore & Atkins, 2000), there is a central sense, with all meanings radiating from this central sense, e.g. all meanings of over share the idea that the 'figure' (smaller object) is, at some stage, above the 'ground' (larger object). All meanings of bed involve a flat surface made of a relatively soft material.

What does the suffix 'mouth' mean? How do you pronounce it in each word? Portsmouth Plymouth Tynemouth Grangemouth Cockermouth Dual systems models of morphology \u00b6 These propose two systems involved in morphological storage / processing: A computational system Words are generated by taking a root and adding an affix (combinatoric symbolic rule) A lexical system Morphologically complex words are stored / processed as wholes in the lexicon Evidence for a computational system \u00b6 We can use morphemes productively He merengu ed his way onto the dance floor She was so angry that she crutch ed her boyfriend There are two wug s Look! The dog is meek ing The dog was un meek able Morphological movement, stranding and substitution errors indicate separate storage of inflectional / derivational morphemes She wash upp ed the dishes. I'd forgot about en that We have a lot of church es in our minister She always pack s a keep He gave me some good de vice Evidence that we process sounds which are potentially morphemes as morphemes ( morpho-phonological parsing - Post et al. 2008). For example reaction times indicate that we parse pseudo-inflections, e.g. mil d (potentially past tense of the verb to mile ) as actual inflections. Words with regular inflectional affixes tend to be phonotactically irregular (e.g. irregular lost rhymes with frost , but regular turned does not rhyme with any other monomorphemic word). This suggests they are not stored. Evidence of the whole-word storage of morphologically-complex words \u00b6 Some complex forms contain non-word roots , indicating that they haven't been built up compositionally, e.g. Un remitt ingly It's in evit able The food supplies were de plete d Some morphemes have multiple meanings, e.g. -er = AGENT, e.g. gardener , or INSTRUMENT, e.g. paint stripper . If words are built up compositionally, how do we know which meaning of -er to select? Psycholinguistic evidence indicates that some morphologically-complex forms are stored as wholes, e.g. Loscewicz (1995) found that inflections in high-frequency inflected forms were significantly shorter than in low-frequency inflected forms -> high-frequency forms were stored as a whole. Alegre and Gordon (1999) found a relationship between whole-word frequency and performance on a nonword discrimination task when whole-word frequency exceeded 1 per 7 million. A hybrid view \u00b6 There is strong evidence for both computational and whole word accounts. Novel inflected forms, e.g. meek ed , must be generated by adding the morpheme. Words with non-word roots, e.g. unre mitt ingly clearly cannot be generated compositionally. So we have two possible** routes to creating morphologically-complex words. High frequency morphologically complex forms are stored in the lexicon Lower frequency forms are generated by computational processes This reflects a trade-off between speed of processing, and expressivity. Whole-word storage of morphologically complex forms -> rapid processing. Separate storage of morphemes allows coining of novel morphologically complex forms, e.g. meek ed **. Pronunciation of mouth in Plymouth versus Cockermouth may reflect two systems (high frequency form, stored as a whole, involves schwa sounds (neutral vowel) The binary view may be too simple. Aitchison (2002) suggests a variety of different levels of storage. For example, the semantic transparency of morphemes (how interpretable they are) exhibits gradient properties. Fogglemouth = This is an imaginary town lying at the mouth of the river 'Foggle'. Suffix -mouth is fully transparent. It is applied using a productive rule > Grangemouth = A real town, but for those outside the Cumbria, this is likely to be a low-frequency word. It may be stored as a whole. Suffix -mouth is less transparent than the -mouth in Fogglemouth > Plymouth = High frquency word stored as unanalysed whole. Suffix mouth is less transparent than in Grangemouth . chickenless (FULLY PRODUCTIVE / TRANSPARENT) > careless (PARTIALLY PRODUCTIVE / TRANSPARENT) > gormless, ruthless (NOT PRODUCTIVE / TRANSPARENT) For chickenless , both morphemes are semantically transparen. The word looks derived. For careless , the morphemes are transparent, but we are likely to store and process the word as a whole. Finally, in gormless and ruthless the roots are not semantically transparent. Morphology in language impairments - Ullman and Pinker's Dual Route model \u00b6 Ullman and Pinker explain language difficulties in terms of the computational and lexical systems, and also give it a neuropsychological grounding. The computational system is governed by procedural memory (involved in the acquisition of unconscious, implicit routines), while the lexical system resides in declarative memory . In particular, they focus on verbs Irregular forms are stored as wholes in the lexicon Regular forms are generated via the computational system (NB Pinker and Ullman accept that high-frequency inflected forms may be stored in the lexicon) The two systems compete with each other under time pressure. If an irregular form is found, the computational process is blocked. If the irregular form is not found, the computational process takes over. Evidence: Frequency effects are only found in the irregular system only Children's overregularisation errors, e.g. she swammed are determined by the density of the irregular neighbourhood which the irregular root belongs to.

Pronunciation of mouth in Plymouth versus Cockermouth may reflect two systems (high frequency form, stored as a whole, involves schwa sounds (neutral vowel) The binary view may be too simple. Aitchison (2002) suggests a variety of different levels of storage. For example, the semantic transparency of morphemes (how interpretable they are) exhibits gradient properties. Fogglemouth = This is an imaginary town lying at the mouth of the river 'Foggle'. Suffix -mouth is fully transparent. It is applied using a productive rule > Grangemouth = A real town, but for those outside the Cumbria, this is likely to be a low-frequency word. It may be stored as a whole. Suffix -mouth is less transparent than the -mouth in Fogglemouth > Plymouth = High frquency word stored as unanalysed whole. Suffix mouth is less transparent than in Grangemouth . chickenless (FULLY PRODUCTIVE / TRANSPARENT) > careless (PARTIALLY PRODUCTIVE / TRANSPARENT) > gormless, ruthless (NOT PRODUCTIVE / TRANSPARENT) For chickenless , both morphemes are semantically transparen.

PRESENT TENSE: At the moment of speaking, the speaker likes cheese. She ate an apple. PAST TENSE: The eating event occurred BEFORE the moment of speaking. English has two morphological tenses (i.e. marked by verb endings): the past and the present. The future is not morphologically marked, but is expressed in a variety of different ways. \"will\" future: I'll help you to carry that shopping. \"going to\" future: I think I'm going to be sick. \"about to\" future: I am about to be sick PRESENT TENSE as future: The train leaves at 6.15 PRESENT PROGRESSIVE as future: We're leaving at 10am. These forms for expressing the future are generally not described as tenses because They are not morphological forms (i.e. they involve more than verb endings) They express meanings above and beyond the future. For example.... \"will\" is used for OFFERS and PREDICTIONS I'll help you with that bag I think it will rain tomorrow \"going to\" is used to talk about the FUTURE BASED ON CURRENT EVIDENCE, or PLANS I think I'm going to be sick (because I feel nauseous) I'm going to apply for a Speech and Language Therapy course PRESENT TENSE is used for a TIMETABLED FUTURE The train leaves at 6.15 PRESENT PROGRESSIVE is used for a FUTURE ARRANGEMENT I'm studying Speech and Language Therapy next year (I already have a place on a course) \"be about to\" is for the NEAR FUTURE The players are warming up. The match is about to begin. Because future forms in English are not strictly tenses, we are going to refer to the \"future tense\" in inverted commas. Next week, we're going to be looking at the syntax/morphology of tense in more detail. Aspect \u00b6 Inherent temporal properties of events \u00b6 Zoetrope - a victorian parlour toy designed to create a moving image (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hE_fA9M580&t=1m18s) Which of the following verbs would make a good zoetrope? swim crash laugh dive pop dance exist For a verb to work in zoetrope it needs (a) 'internal structure' (b) no definite end point, e.g. running, walking, swimming. We can see that certain verbs have particular temporal properties. These properties are referred to as \"lexical aspect\" (sometimes called \"aktionsarten\") ### (a) States versus non-states \u00b6 States are abstract, and do not have \"internal structure\" (e.g. \"existing\" doesnt' vary in any way across time, while when you are running, different snapshots will show your arms and legs in completely different positions). Non-states have internal structure. Examples of states are \"existing verbs\", be, live, exist, \"experiencer-theme verbs\", e.g. like, love, hate , and mental state verbs, e.g. believe, know, hope . Tests... Because they are abstract they are difficult to define. E.g. you can give a good definition of run , but try to give a definition of exist , or like State verbs sound odd in the progressive (-ing form), e.g. ?? she is existing, ??she is liking the food, ??I am believing in fairies . This is becuase the progressive places us inside the event, and this is difficult to do when an event does not have a rich internal structure. They sound odd as reponses to the question what happened? , e.g. Q. What happened? ???A. She liked the food (b) Activities versus events \u00b6 Activities do not have a natural end point (they are \"atelic\"). Events have a natural end point (they are \"telic\"). Examples of activities are run, walk, wash, work . Examples of events are break, collapse, crash, fall Because activities do not have a natural endpoint, they sound good when used with time expressions which imply an incomplete activity e.g. I've been walking for an hour (and I may continue to walk for another hour). By contrast events sound odd when used with such time expressions, e.g ${ }$ It collapsed for an hour. * Events sound good with time expressions which imply a complete activity, e.g. The bridge collapsed in five seconds . Activities do not sound good with such time expressions, e.g. ${ }$ He walked in five minutes* (c) Accomplishments versus achievements \u00b6 Achievements are instantaneous events, taking place in a very brief instant, while accomplishments can take place over an extended period of time. The linguistic term to descibe this phenomenon is \"durative\" (see table below). A durative event is one which is extended in time. Because Achievements are instantaneous / non-durative, they cannot be stopped in the middle, e.g. ? They stopped reaching the summit ? The balloon stopped popping This contrasts with Accomplishments which can be stopped in the middle, eg. She stopped jumping over the stairs They stopped building the house In addition, because Accomplishments are extended in time, we can use them with progressive grammatical aspect, while we cannot do this with Acheivements, e.g. They are building the house ? They are reaching the summit Dynamic (Rich internal structure) Durative (Occurs during prolonged period) Telic (Bounded) State - + - Activity + + - Accomplishment + + + Achievement - - + Summary of tests \u00b6 Definition test: States are relatively hard to define. What happened test: Doesn't sound good with States Present progressive (-ing form): States and Achievements do not sound good in the progressive \"for\" test: Activities sound good with a \"for\" expression, but not events. \"in\" test: Events sound good with \"in\" but not activities \"Stop\" test: Achievements do not sound good with \"stop\", e.g. she stopped reaching the top of the mountain Multiple lexical aspects \u00b6 Some verbs seem to have more than one lexical aspect I like cheese (STATE) She liked my post on facebook (i.e. pressed \"like\") (ACHIEVEMENT) I have a car (STATE) She's having a good time (ACTIVITY) I love that dress (STATE) I'm loving this book (ACTIVITY???) Be quiet. I'm thinking (ACTIVITY) I think you're really rude (STATE) So what's going on here? One possibility is that each verb has two different meanings corresponding to different lexical aspects. This is certainly the case for think ( thinking as an activity versus think =believe). With other verbs it's possibly to identify a primary meaning, and a secondary meaning which is an extension of the primary meaning, e.g. love = STATE -> loving = ACTIVITY. Some verbs can `shift' lexical aspect depending on sentence context; She's is dancing (ACTIVITY) She finally danced the tango (ACHIEVEMENT) The light is flashing (ACTIVITY, NB there is an `iterative' interpretation) The light flashed (ACHIEVEMENT) However, it is often possible to identify a `core', most frequently used lexical aspect. Exercise \u00b6 What is the lexical aspect of the following verbs? fly sing flatten paint cover suck flash Grammatical aspect \u00b6 Grammatical aspect refers to grammatical devices to signal one's perpsective on an event . In English there are two grammatical aspects: PROGRESSIVE and PERFECTIVE. The progressive (-ing form), signals an INTERNAL perspective on the event, while the perfective (-en form) signals an EXTERNAL perspective on the event, He is danc ing (PROGRESSIVE aspect) She is sing ing (PROGRESSIVE aspect) We are \"inside\" the event in the sense that the event continues up till the time of speaking, and will continue after the time of speaking. King Kong has fall en (PERFECTIVE aspect) I have brok en the chair (PERFECTIVE aspect) We are \"outside\" the event in the sense that the event is complete. Other languages have richer systems, e.g Spanish differentiates between the Imperfective and the Progressive. Tense is not aspect \u00b6 Students often confuse tense and aspect. Don't worry, this is normal, as these concepts are very closely related. Here are two sentences which demostrate the difference: By this time next week, I will have eaten all of the tins of baked beans in my cupboard This sentence uses the \"WILL\" FUTURE, but perfective aspect to express COMPLETION She was sleeping when the earthquake happened This sentence is in the PAST TENSE but uses progressive aspect to describe an ONGOING event. Combinations of tense, grammatical and lexical aspect \u00b6 Tense, grammatical and lexical aspect combine in weird and wonderful ways. This is a very complex system and we can only begin to scrape the surface. (a) Present tense and Activity/Accomplishment/Achievement verbs \u00b6 When present tense is used with Activities, Accomplishments and Achievements, we get a HABITUAL intepretation, e.g. She sings every day. He works in a call centre He smashes things (he's clumsy or aggressive) (b) Progressive grammatical aspect and achievement verbs \u00b6 This conveys an iterative interpretation (repeated events) The light is flashing He's flattening boxes Tense/aspect and SLT practice \u00b6 Children with SLI have difficulties marking tense, e.g. He went there -> Him go there However, this is a difficulty with the morphological expression of tense, rather than a difficulty understanding what tense means. Young children, when acquiring tense, conflate tense and aspect . They are more likely to mark paste tense on Achievement and Accomplishment verbs, because these tend to describe COMPLETED events. Some studies have argued that by manipulating the lexical aspect of verbs you can help children acquire tense (Van Horne, A. J. O., Fey, M., & Curran, M. (2017). Do the Hard Things First: A Randomized Controlled Trial Testing the Effects of Exemplar Selection on Generalization Following Therapy for Grammatical Morphology.

Clinical implications of the effects of lexical aspect and phonology on children\u2019s production of the regular past tense. Child Language Teaching and Therapy , 23 (3), 287\u2013306.) In fact, Van Horne et al. found that children with DLD were better at producing the past tense forms when trained on more difficult items! Some studies have found that language-impaired children have difficulties comprehending and producing grammatical aspect (Fletcher, P., Leonard, L. B., Stokes, S. F., & Wong, A. M. Y. (2005).

Young children, when acquiring tense, conflate tense and aspect . They are more likely to mark paste tense on Achievement and Accomplishment verbs, because these tend to describe COMPLETED events. Some studies have argued that by manipulating the lexical aspect of verbs you can help children acquire tense (Van Horne, A. J. O., Fey, M., & Curran, M. (2017).

Past tense shows that we adopt a PRESENT VIEWPOINT on the event.

Most functions are defined in relation to the verb . 5 minute exercise \u00b6 Try to learn the following artificial language Gugo bikavit lamnok = 'The cat chased the dog' Lopo bikavit tunglish = 'The cat ate the food' Lopo gugo lamnok = 'The dog likes the food' What does the following sentence mean? Bikavit gugo tunglish How did you complete the artificial language learning task? You figured out that particular positions in the sentences had particular FUNCTIONS. e.g. Subject, Verb, Object. Functions and sentence position \u00b6 Obligatory functions - Subjects and Verbs \u00b6 Almost all sentences of English needs a Subject and a Verb [ Syntax $ {SUBJECT}$ ] rocks! $ {VERB}$ [ Madonna $ {SUBJECT}$ ] sings $ {VERB}$ [ That donkey $ {SUBJECT}$ ] kicks! $ {VERB}$ The Subject is often the do-er, e.g. Madonna is the person who sings, and the donkey is the thing that kicks. However, in the following sentence Breakfast is served Breakfast is not the do-er. This shows that functions express a relationship which is only loosely linked to meaning . Functions express syntactic relationships , and are more closely related to sentence position than meaning. For example, in English, the Noun Phrase which comes immediately before the verb is always the Subject. In many languages the formal relationship between subject and verb is expressed via agreement . This means that the form of the verb is linked to the type of subject, e.g. Person Singular Plural 1st (speaker) I sing We sing 2nd (addressee) You sing You sing 3rd (person outside the conversation) She sing-s They sing We can see that the English paradigm is very sparse. However, other languages have much richer verb agreement paradigms, e.g. Spanish and Latin. Functions which are \"chosen\" by the verb \u00b6 (a) Objects \u00b6 After the verb, we often (but not always) have an Object Syntax rocks [ my world! $_{OBJECT}$ ] Madonna sings [ catchy tunes $_{OBJECT}$ ] That donkey kicks [ people $_{OBJECT}$ ] These are \"chosen\" by the verb in the sense that only certain verbs can take objects. For example, after the verbs yawn and run we typically do not have objects, e.g. He yawned She ran These are called intransitive verbs. Some verbs take two objects, in which case we have a direct and an indirect object . Direct Object (Od in LARSP) Indirect Object (Oi in LARSP) Meaning The thing which changes location / possession, e.g. She gave the ball to Jack The thing which receives the transferred entity, e.g. She gave the ball to Jack ** Animacy Often inanimate Often animate Syntax Does not come after a preposition Often comes after a preposition Note that the Indirect Object is \"parasitic\" on the Direct Object in the sense that it needs a Direct Object in order to be realised; Janet gave [ a book $_{Direct~Object}$] Janet gave [ a book $ {Direct~Object}$]. [ to Mary $ {Indirect~Object}$ ] ?? Janet gave [ to Mary $_{Indirect~Object}$ ] For the following sentences, which are the direct and indirect objects? Albert showed Victoria his stamp collection Ennis brought a book for Angie Could you rustle me up an omellete? Patricia sent her friend a letter NB sometimes there is more than one option to realise direct versus indirect objects: Abdul sent Josh a letter (called the \"Double Object Dative\") Abdul sent a letter to Josh (called the \"Prepositional Dative\") Od and Oi are \"chosen\" by the verb, in the sense that there are particular verbs which tend to take two objects. Groups of verbs taking two objects are verbs of physical transfer ( give, take, receive, lend, borrow, deliver, donate, show ) and verbs of metaphorical transfer ( tell, explain ) (b) Subject and Object complements \u00b6 Subject Complements (Cs) are phrases which describe a property of the subject , while Object Complements (Co) describe a property of the object . Here are some examples: Jack is [ terrible at maths ] = Cs describing Subject Jack Ali appears [ troubled ] at the moment = Cs describing Subject Ali I consider him [ my best friend ] = Co describing Object him I want that bedroom [ cleaned ] by tomorrow = Co describing Object bedroom Genevieve painted her bedroom walls [ dark green ] = Co describing Object her bedroom walls The mechanic hammered the panel [ flat ] = Co describing Object the panel Note that while Subjects and Objects are realised as Noun Phrases, Subject and Object Complements can be realised in many ways, e.g. as Adjective Phrases (e.g. terrible at maths ), or as Prepositional Phrases, e.g. he ripped the paper [ into pieces ] . Here is a list of verbs which tend to take complements Verbs which can take subject complements The copula - is/are/was/were Verbs of appearance - seem, appear, look, e.g. she seems / looks / appears tired Verbs of perception - *feel, smell, sound, taste, e.g. the food smells / tastes funny Verbs of persistence - stay, remain, e.g. You must stay / remain calm Verbs which can take object complements : appoint, call, certify, consider, crown, declare, elect, find, hold, imagine, keep, like, make, name, prefer, proclaim, profess, pronounce, prove, report, send, think, turn Complements are less moveable than objects. For example, in (1) and (2) below, we can move the objects to the front of the sentence. But this is not the case for complements (3) and (4) Jack gave Peter the book -> The book was given to Peter by Jack Jack gave Peter the book -> Peter was given the book by Jack Jack resembles Paul -> * Paul is resembled by Jack Magda named her daughter Isobel -> * Isobel was named her daughter by Magda NB these types of sentences are all examples of \"the passive\" which will be covered next semester Optional modifying functions \u00b6 Post-modifiers and Adverbials \u00b6 In many cases, the verb determines the functions which we can use, e.g. sit cannot be used with an Object Noun Phrase. Jack sat $*$ Jack sat [ the chair $_{OBJECT NOUN PHRASE}$] All of the above functions are, more-or-less, \"chosen\" by the verb. However, there are two functions which are not \"chosen\" by the verb: Adverbial and Postmodifier. An adverbial is a phrase (consisting of either a single word, or a group of words) which (a) modifies the verb or the sentence, and (b) occupies a \"peripheral\" position in the sentence, i.e. at the very beginning or the very end, and (c) can occur in EITHER peripheral position (i.e. it can be placed either at the beginning or end) [ On Tuesday ] we should have a picnic [ in my opinion ] [ With a bit of luck ] we will have good weather [ from tomorrow ] Though luckily in the following sentence has precisely the same function as the Adverbial with a bit of luck it is not peripheral, and therefore we are not categorising it as an adverbial. It is a adverb coming inside the Verb Complex. We [ luckily had $_{VERB~COMPLEX}$] good weather While Adverbials modify the verb, or sentence, Postmodifiers modify the Noun. They come after the noun, e.g. The man [ with the red hat ] followed me down the street The dog [ that scratched me ] was a Border Collie Functions and morphology \u00b6 Case-marking \u00b6 The syntactic function of a word or phrase may impact on its morphology. This phenomenon is called case-marking . A word whose morphology demonstrates its syntactic function is said to be case-marked . In English, case-marking only applies to Pronouns: Subject form (called NOMINATIVE or SUBJECTIVE case) = I, you, he/she/it, we, you, they Od, Oi, Cs, Co form (called ACCUSATIVE or OBJECTIVE form) = Me, you, him/her/it, us, you. them We also apply the GENITIVE CASE (denoting possession) to Nouns, e.g. She scratched Anna's car. Other language have much richer case systems, e.g. with special forms for direct versus indirect objects, and the possibility of marking case on Nouns as well as pronouns. Functions and language impairments \u00b6 Language-impaired children \u00b6 Language-impaired children occasionally omit subjects. This is a pattern found in younger typically-development children (Grela 1997, 2003) (He) went there. They also have case-marking difficulties in subject position, often using the accusative case, instead, e.g. Him go there. They also fail to inflect the verb which results in a loss of Subject-Verb agreement (as shown above, correct form of the verb is goes ) LARSP framework \u00b6 This is a framework for assessing child language taught in Linguistics II. It is designed to determine the child's syntactic level. To perform a LARSP analysis, you must determine the complexity of syntactic functions, e.g. She likes it = Simple one-word subject and object The girl likes the boy = Two-word subject and object containing Determiner + Noun combination. 5 minute exercise \u00b6 What is wrong with the following sentences?

Apart from the main cause (\"We're looking for Girls\", \"Always should be someone\"), this has 6 dependent clauses with finite verbs: ...who are boys Who like boys to be girls Who do boys like they're girls Who do girls like they're boys. \u2026you really love We're going to be looking at these different types of clauses. Other types of dependent clause \u00b6 Last week, we looked at adverbial clauses, these come inside an adverbial: [ When [ I fall in love ADVERBIAL.CLAUSE $]$ ADVERBIAL ] it will be forever Dependent clauses can come inside any other syntactic function (except the Verb Complex): S, Od, Oi, Cs, Co, and Pmod Dependent clauses as a complement of the verb (Od, Oi, Cs, Co) \u00b6 Od and Oi position \u00b6 Dependent clauses in Direct Object position Last night I dreamt [ (that) somebody loved me Od ] (the Smiths) I'll tell $[$ you Oi ] [ what I want Od ] (Spice Girls) I told [ you Oi ] [ I was ill Od ] (Spike Milligan's Epitaph) It may be easier to see that it is a Direct Object if you substitute it for the word \"something\" (the SOMETHING TEST!!) Last night I dreamt SOMETHING \u2192 somebody loved me. I told you SOMETHING \u2192 I was ill. I'll tell you SOMETHING \u2192 What I want. Cs and Co position \u00b6 Clauses can also come as Subject or Object Complement Money, that's [ what I want Cs ] (Barrett Strong - Old Motown Hit) I'll name [ this ship Od ] [ whatever I want Co ] (King Charles - (hungover)) Again, we can substitute the phrase with SOMETHING: Money, that's SOMETHING I'll name this ship SOMETHING Dependent clauses in Subject Position \u00b6 Here is an example of a dependent clause in subject position [ That she passed the exam S ] surprised her teacher. However, it sounds a bit weird. It would be much more natural to say to move the long Subject to the end and replace it with a dummy/expletive \"it\": It surprised her teacher [ that she passed the exam ] Why does this happen? In English we do not like very long phrases ar the beginning of a sentence. Here is another example I feel _ about weddings [ the way cats feel about waterslides ] (Nell Frizelle, Guardian) The phrase \"the way cats feel about waterslides\" has moved from its initial position (shown by the underscore): I feel [ the way cats feel about waterslides ] about weddings. But this just doesn't work!! Some researchers have suggested that there is a cross-linguistic tendency to shift long phrases to the end of a sentence to \"save the difficult things till last\". However, some languages seem to like long phrases at the front (Japanese). Dependent clauses in Post-modifer Position \u00b6 A postmodifier is a phrase which comes after a noun and modifies it. I found the book [ under the sofa ] I saw a man [ with the wooden leg ] Clauses can also come in postmodifier position She never gave me a reason [ why she arrived late ] I didn't believe Giles' claim [ that Geoff ate the chocolate cake ] I found the book [ that was under the sofa ] I saw a man [ who had a wooden leg ] The final two examples are \"relative\" clauses. Focus on relative clauses \u00b6 Girls who are boys... \u00b6 This is the type of clause that appears in the chorus of Girls and Boys: (We're) Looking for Girls who are boys Who like boys to be girls Who do boys like they're girls Who do girls like they're boys . Always should be someone you really love. The restrictive / non-restrictive distinction \u00b6 These are \"restrictive\" relative clauses. They take a set of entities, and restrict them to those entities with a specific property. e.g. \"girls who are boys\" is a subset of \"girls\". We can also use non-restrictive relative clauses, which just provide extra information. The Paris which is in Texas is warmer than the Paris which is in France (restrictive relative clauses) Paris, which is the capital of France , is a lovely city (non-restrictive relative clauses) Properties of relative clauses \u00b6 (a) Summary of properties Relative clauses have a number of interesting properties. They are headed by a relative pronoun (who, that, which). The can contain unusual word orders (e.g. There's the cat$ {OBJ}$ I$ {SUB}$ saw$_{VERB}$ ) They can split Subjects from Verbs (b) The relative pronoun The word which introduces the relative clause ( that, which, who ) is best described as a Pronoun. Why? She likes her : Pronouns are marked for CASE. She likes it : Pronouns are marked for ANIMACY DISTINCTION Now let's look at case-marking in relative pronouns: There's the man who saw him There's the man whom he saw And the animacy distinction There's the man who I saw. I found the money that I dropped. Occasionally the relative pronoun can be omitted: I found the money (that) I dropped The rules for this are slightly complicated. We can imagine the relative pronoun as \"moving\" to the front of the relative clause: He saw him -> There's the man whom he saw. (c) Unusual word orders When the relative pronoun refers to the OBJECT, we have an unusual (OSV) word order: There's the man who Obj. I Subj. saw V There's the fish that that Obj. she Subj. ate V (d) Splitting subjects from verbs If relative clauses come in the middle of sentences they can split Subjects from Verbs The man [ who I saw ] was happy This makes sentences with centre-embedded relative clauses particularly hard to process. Relative clauses in research \u00b6 Relative clauses are very widely used in linguistic research because: They vary in interesting ways across languages In some languages they allow you create simple and complex versions of the same sentence WITHOUT MAKING ANY CHANGES TO THE WORDS IN THE SENTENCE e.g. There's the cat that chased the dog / There's the dog that the cat chased This is incredibly useful because we can control for lexical factors and sentence length, while focusing on syntactic complexity. They are very sensitive to overall linguistic ability. Language impaired individuals find relative clauses particularly difficult to process.","title":"14 - Other types of dependent clause"},{"location":"lecture%20notes/16%20-%20Other%20types%20of%20dependent%20clauses/#14-other-types-of-dependent-clause","text":"","title":"14 - Other types of dependent clause"},{"location":"lecture%20notes/16%20-%20Other%20types%20of%20dependent%20clauses/#homework","text":"(We're) Looking for Girls who are boys Who like boys to be girls Who do boys like they're girls Who do girls like they're boys.

Here we are using complement in a broader fashion to describe 'ways of completing the sentence'. Under this broader definition, direct and indirect objects can also be described as complements Complements versus Modifying Phrases (a) \u00b6 Complements are \"chosen\" by verbs, or other words/phrases in the sentence. They sentence sounds odd without them. Modifying phrases feel \"added on\". They are optional. There are two types of modifying phrases, Adverials, and Postmodifiers (see below). Complements of the verb \u00b6 All post-verbal arguments can be described as complements of the verb. These are Od, Oi, Co, Cs. So far, we have only looked at phrasal complements, e.g. Noun Phrases, Adjective Phrases, or Prepositional Phrases. Amy dropped [ the pen $_{NP}$ ] Jack painted $[$ the roof $ {NP}$ $]$ $[$ bright red $ {Adj.}$ $]$ Jack smashed $[$ the vase $ {NP}$ $]$ $[$ into pieces $ {Prep.~Phrase}$ $]$ Verbs can also specify clausal complements (i.e. mini sentences) Jack said [ that he was hungry $_{Clause}$ ] Magda alleged $[$ that Carter was seeing another woman $_{Clause (with \"that\")}$ $]$ Angie told $[$ Mel $ {NP}$ $]$ $[$ that she was seeing another woman $ {Clause (with \"that\")}$ $]$ When a clause is used a complement it takes on the same function as the equivalent Noun Phrase, e.g. Angie told $[$ Mel $ {NP = Oi}$ $]$ $[$ something $ {Od}$ $]$ Angie told $[$ Mel $ {NP = Oi}$ $]$ $[$ that she was seeing another woman $ {Clause = Od}$ $]$ Complements of other words \u00b6 Complements of Adjectives Jack is afraid [ of pigeons $_{PP}$ ] Jack is afraid [ for his friend $_{PP}$ ] Jack is afraid [ that pigeons will get him $_{Clause (with \"that\")}$ ] Annie is surprised [ by Greg's behaviour $_{PP}$ ] Annie is surprised [ at Greg's behaviour $_{PP}$ ] Annie is surprised [ that Greg came late $_{Clause (with \"that\")}$ ] Mei Lin is disappointed [ by the news $_{PP}$ ] Mei Lin is disappointed [ about the news $_{PP}$ ] Mei Lin is disappointed [ that Greg came late $_{Clause (with \"that\")}$ ] Complements of Nouns Donna's belief [ in fairies $_{PP}$ ] is amusing Anna's fear [ of lamp posts $_{PP}$ ] is puzzling The destruction [ of the temple $_{PP}$ ] shocked the tribes of Israel A recap on terminology \u00b6 Phrases = Groups of words which behave as a whole . We can do tests for phrases, e.g. can you question them or substitute them? Functions = A label to describe the syntactic role which phrases play in a sentence. NB though certain functions tend to have certain semantic roles , functions are primarily syntactic , e.g. The sweets were given to all those with perfect marks The sweets is the Direct Object of the \"underlying\" sentence, e.g. she gave the sweets to the child . However, here the sweets has been moved into Subject position, and is therefore a subject . Note that it has the formal syntactic properties of a Subject, namely subject-verb agreement ( the sweets are / were ), and nominative case-marking when the Noun Phrase is replaced by a pronoun ( they / them were given to all those with perfect marks ) Argument = Essential Participants in the event described by the verb. The arguments are chosen by the verbs. The verb also specifies the role fo the arguments, and their order. Complement (narrow definition) = Word to describe a post-verbal argument which serves to modify either the Subject or Object. Complement (broader definition) = A phrase which \"completes\" the sentence. It is chosen by a particular word, and comes after that word. Postverbal arguments (e.g. Od, Oi, Co, Ci) can be described as complements of the verb. However, other word classes can have complements, e.g. Adjectives and Nouns. Complements versus Modifiers (b) \u00b6 Adverbials and Post-modifiers \u00b6 As mentioned, there are two modifying functions: Adverbials and Postmodifiers. While Adverbials tend to modify the entire sentence, Postmodifiers modify the preceding Noun Phrase. $[$ Next Tuesday $ {Adverbial}$ $]$ we'll sell our house $[$ with any luck $ {Adverbial}$ $]$ The house $[$ at the end of the street $_{PP acting as~Post-Modifer}$ $]$ was for sale The house $[$ that was at the end of the street $_{Clause acting as~Post-Modifer}$ $]$ was for sale Both types of modifying phrases are optional. Adverbials are also moveable, and are able to occur at either peripheral position (the very beginning or very end of the sentence). Focus on adverbials \u00b6 Adverbials and adverbs refer to almost the same thing Adverb = a single word which tends to sit in the verb complex and modfies the verb, e.g. She $[$ quickly ran $_{Verb~Complex}$ $]$ to the shops Adverbial = a phrase (often containing multiple words) which sits at the sentence periphery, and modifies the entire sentence, e.g. $[$ Next Tuesday $ {Adverbial}$ $]$ we'll sell our house $[$ with any luck $ {Adverbial}$ $]$ Adverbials have a variety of functions. They can be used to express manner, place, or time, e.g. MANNER: She walks [ with a slight limp ] PLACE: She plays cricket [ in the park ] TIME: [ On Tuesday ] she sold the house The can also express a variety of discourse functions, e.g. CHANGING TOPIC: [ Anway ], have you heard the news about Ruth? EXPRESSING LOGICAL RELATIONSHIPS: [ However ], she still couldn't lift heavy weights. (NB the sentence CONTRADICTS information in the preceding discourse, e.g. She trained hard. However she still couldn't lift heavy weights ). EXPRESSING AN OPINION: [ In my opinion ] we should treat syntactic difficulties using recasts Focus on Post-modifiers \u00b6 Can be either a Prepositional Phrase or a clause: The man [ with the hat $_{PP}$ ] lost his wallet The man [ who was wearing a hat $_{Clause}$ ] lost his wallet The man [ who was wearing a hat $_{Reduced~clause}$ ] lost his wallet Distinguishing between complements and modifiers \u00b6 While complements \"snuggle up\" to the word that specifies them, modifiers can be separated from that word; The teacher $[$ of mathematics $ {PP}$ $]$ $[$ with red hair $ {PP}$ $]$ just won the lottery *The teacher $[$ with red hair $ {PP}$ $]$ $[$ of mathematics $ {PP}$ $]$ just won the lottery Jeanine filled the car $[$ with petrol $ {PP}$ $]$ $[$ on Tuesday $ {PP}$ $]$ *Jeanine filled the car $[$ on Tuesday $ {PP}$ $]$ $[$ with petrol $ {PP}$ $]$ Jack is proud $[$ of his achievements $ {PP}$ $]$ $[$ with good reason $ {PP}$ $]$ *Jack is proud $[$ with good reason $ {PP}$ $]$ $[$ of his achievements $ {PP}$ $]$ Complements and lexical representation \u00b6 Are complements predictable from meaning? \u00b6 How do we know which type of complement to use after a verb, adjective or noun? To a certain extent complement types are predictable from the meaning of the verb, noun, or adjective. For example, we tend to use clausal complements with mental state verbs because clauses describe imaginary scenes or situations which we are able to think about. I hope [ that you won't miss the train ] I imagine [ that he was very angry ] I believe [ that he's in a relationship ] However, complements are not wholly predictable from meaning. Why are we surprised by something, but delighted with something? Admire and like have very similar meanings (a positive emotion about someone) but they differ very much in their syntactic behaviour: I like $[\u200b$ that you don't get down about stuff $_{that plus clause}\u200b$ $]\u200b$ ?? I admire $[$ that you don't get down about stuff $_{that plus clause}$ $]$ The answer is that the word specifies its own syntactic behaviour. The lemma (and the lexeme) \u00b6 We were introduced to the \"lemma\" at the end of Week 3. This is a level where word-mearnings are stored. By contrast, word-forms are stored at a later level, the \"lexeme\" level. Evidence for the separation of the \"lemma\" and \"lexeme\" levels comes from tip-of-the-tongue phenomena, and phonological substitutions. The lemma also contains the complement-selection properties of a word. This helps us to use the word in a sentence, e.g. by determining the structure of the sentence after the word. Perhaps the strongest motivation for the lemma comes from languages where nouns have genders, e.g. masculine and feminine, e.g. French, Italian, Spanish. Data from patient \"Dante\" (Badecker et al. 1995), an individual with aphasia, suggests that the ability to report the gender of a word, is independent of the ability to name that word. This suggests the separation of the lemma and the lexeme. Roughly-speaking the lemma contains modality-general information about a word, while the lexeme contains modality-specific information. Five-minute exercise \u00b6 Look at the following speech errors. What does this say about the integration between (a) planning the structure of the sentence, and (b) inserting words in sentences, and (c) producing phonemes. I'm a weekend for maniacs.

Evidence for the separation of the \"lemma\" and \"lexeme\" levels comes from tip-of-the-tongue phenomena, and phonological substitutions. The lemma also contains the complement-selection properties of a word. This helps us to use the word in a sentence, e.g. by determining the structure of the sentence after the word. Perhaps the strongest motivation for the lemma comes from languages where nouns have genders, e.g. masculine and feminine, e.g. French, Italian, Spanish. Data from patient \"Dante\" (Badecker et al. 1995), an individual with aphasia, suggests that the ability to report the gender of a word, is independent of the ability to name that word.

Now we are going to combine these into units called 'phrases' A phrase is a group of words which behaves like a single single unit. The phrase tends to takes its name from the word which expresses the meaning of the phrase, e.g. (i) Jack saw [a fascinating TV programme] -> Phrase is about a programme, programme is a noun, therefore it is a NOUN PHRASE (ii) Rufus likes drinking beer [in his local pub] -> Phrase is about a location, the location is expressed by the preposition, therefore this is a PREPOSITIONAL PHRASE.

If we attempt to move a group of words which is not a phrase, the sentence sound ungrammatical. Yoda (above) speak provides plenty of examples of the movement test, e.g. (a) [Mourn them] do not _ .

(Movement of Noun Phrase) (d) [Forever] it will dominate your destiny _ (Movement of Adverb Phrase. NB phrases can be single words. We can turn this into a multi-word phrase: For the rest of time.... ) Omission test Some phrases may be omitted. If a group of words may be omitted, it is likely to be a phrase, e.g. The man (in the moon) came down (too soon) (omission of prepositional phrase, and adverb phrase). This test is probably the weakest test, as not all phrases may be omitted. Filler test Fillers are words which we use to 'fill in' pauses. We tend to use them to 'cover up' disfluences.

What does this say about the integration between (a) planning the structure of the sentence, and (b) inserting words in sentences, and (c) producing phonemes. I'm a weekend for maniacs. Conclusions: The sentence frame is appropriate but the words are in the wrong position. Therefore, it looks as if the sentence frame has been chosen before the words have been inserted The voicing on maniacs is consistent with the previous consonant. Therefore the voicing rule has been applied after the word swap has taken place. Combining these two observations, we have evidence for 3 stages: (1) a stage which involves the selection of the frame (2) a stage which involves the insertion of words (3) a phonetic stage where the phonetic realisation of affixes is determined. Models of sentence production \u00b6 These all start with an abstract plan of what we're going to say, and finish with a precise articulated form. The dominant models were proposed by Garrett (1975) and Levelt (1989). Garrett proposes 5 stages Message level - Very abstract representation of what we are going to say Functional level - Activations of relevant lemmas. Still no syntactic frame Positional level - Syntactic frame chosen, insertion of invariant lexemes/morphemes Phonetic level - Insertion of variant lexemes/morphemes and syllabification Articulatory level - Speech motor programme assembled. Levelt proposes a more course-grained hierarchy Conceptual level (corresponding to Garrett's message level) Formulation level (corresponding to Garrett's Function, Positional, and Phonetic levels) Articulation level (corresponding to Garrett's Articulatory level) 1. The message level \u00b6 1a. What information is represented at the message level? \u00b6 A mental representation of the thoughts we wish to put into words. We know what entities we wish to talk about, and what kind of situation or event they are participating in. We must encode relational information , e.g. what is the relationship between an entity and an action? Is that entity the AGENT of the action, or the PATIENT of the action. At a later stage, the entities will be mapped onto arguments , while the situation/event will be mapped onto the verb . In addition, to specifying entities and situations we take a particular perspective on the action. For example, we to decide which entity to focus on. Typically, the thing were are focusing on will come in non-subject position, will be specified with a full Noun Phrase (as opposed to a pronoun), and will take stress, e.g. I saw a strange man in the street. $[$ He $ {TOPIC}$ $]$ was wearing $[$ the weirdest clothes I've ever seen $ {FOCUS}$ $]$. We must also decide when the event took place (which will be expressed via tense ), and how we wish to focus on the verb, e.g. do we wish to be inside the event, or outside the event. This is expressed as grammatical aspect . John has chopped the carrot = PERFECTIVE aspect for completed event John is chopping the carrot = PROGRESSIVE aspect for ongoing event 1b. How do we get from the Message level to the Functional level? \u00b6 We retrieve (a) the lemmas (b) the argument structure We assign thematic thematic relations 2. Functional level \u00b6 2a. What information is represented at the functional level? \u00b6 Consists of semantic information : arguments with correct roles Focusing information (e.g. which arguments to focus on, or how we are going to focus on the verb) may also be represented at this level There is no syntactic informatio n, e.g. how we are going to order the words in a sentence. 2b. How do we get from the Functional level to the Positional level? \u00b6 We retrieve (a) the lexemes (b) the syntactic frame We link or map the arguments to their correct position in the frame. The syntactic planning frame consists of (a) closed class morphemes, and (b) slots/placeholders for open class morphemes, e.g. [DET] \u2026\u2026.. [AUX-be] \u2026\u2026... [+prog].[DET] \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 [PREP].[DET] \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026... ( dative , e.g. the woman is giving the flowers to the boy ) [DET] \u2026\u2026.. [AUX-be] \u2026\u2026... [+perf].[PREP].[DET] \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. (passive , e.g. the cat was chased by the dog ) [DET] \u2026\u2026... \u2026\u2026...\u2026[+past].[DET]\u2026\u2026.... [PREP].[DET]\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.... ( locative , e.g. the dog chased the cat up the tree ) The linking problem \u00b6 How do we ensure that right arguments get assigned to the right surface position? Jackendoff (1990) proposes a thematic hierarchy. We align arguments in a specific order based on their roles (e.g. AGENT > PATIENT > RECIPIENT) We then assign these arguments to slots in the frame on a one-by-one basis. But note this won't always give the right results, e.g. The man$ {AG.}$ gave the woman$ {REC.}$ the present$_{PAT.}$ Errors in children \u00b6 Have a look at these errors in children. How have they arisen? Can I fill some salt into the bear? I'm going to cover a screen over me. (Bowerman, 1982) The lady is filling the sweets into the jar. The lady is covering the scarf on her head. (Ebbels, 2007) 3. Positional level \u00b6 3a. What information is represented at the Positional level? \u00b6 Now we have syntactic information! We represent the sentence frame , and lexemes which are phonetically invariant (i.e. their pronunciation is similar whatever context they occur in) 3b. How do we get from the Positional level to the Phonetic level? \u00b6 We retreive (a) segments, and (b) metrical structure We assemble a phonological sequence (consisting of segments, combined with metrical structure). Evidence that segments and metrical structure are stored separately: Stress shift - to ensure that stressed syllables do not come close to each other. She's fif- teen / I saw fif -teen men . Five o' clock in the after- noon / We had after -noon tea . It was ca-ta- stroph -ic / It was a ca -ta-strophic fai lure Evidence from aphasia (Nickels & Howard, 1999) Aphasic individuals often produce phonemes in correct order, but not correct stress pattern Are much better at naming items with more frequent stress patterns 4. Phonetic level \u00b6 4a. What is represented at the phonetic level? \u00b6 A phonological sequence consisting of segments, and information related to metrical structure (e.g. word stress). Phonetically-variant lexemes/phonemes are realised at this level, e.g. DETERMINER: A book / A n elephant DETERMINER: Th e man / Th e essay (tongue is retracted for second) PARTICLE: I want t o eat / I want t o drink (second is longer and involves more lip rounding) A number of errors may occur at this level including Swapping errors, e.g. cherry tart -> terry chart Anticipation errors, e.g. terry tart -> terry chart Perseveration errors, e.g. cherry tart -> cherry chart NB these errors respect syllabic position, so perhaps they occur later at the syllable retrieval stage? 4b. How do we get from the Phonetic level to the Articulatory level? \u00b6 We retrieve syllables, along with their articulation plans. We assemble motor instructions. Motivation for syllables as units of representation \u00b6 Liaison, e.g. why are you said -> wai - j - a: -ju: - sad Resyllabification (where a segment from one word/morpheme occurs in a syllable with segments from another word/morpheme) A versus An - /n/ is resyllabified Last h hour - aspiration phenomena suggest that /t/ has been rsyllabified (as aspiration only occurs syllable-initially) Bibliography \u00b6 Bowerman, M.

Here it takes an object ( the napkin ), and a Prepositional Phrase expressing location ( off the table ). This is a very unusual use of sneeze . However, the meaning is transparent, that our sneeze propells the napkin off the table. The question is how are we able to comprehenend and produce such an utterance? Traditional verb-centric story: we access the verb, then retrieve the argument structure from the lemma. PROBLEM: sneeze is unlikely to specify an argument structure with 3 entities. It is theoretically possible that we have a special meaning of sneeze in our lexicons, e.g. sneeze = make a sudden involuntary expulsion of air from the nose and mouth due to irritation of one's nostrils such that the resulting air flow propels an object X from location Y . But this is unlikely given the rarity of sentences with sneeze and three arguments. The meaning of the sentence comes, in part, form the sentence frame or 'construction'. The construction NP$_1$ + V + NP$_2$ + PP means NP$_1$ acts upon NP$_2$ such that NP$_2$ changes location . The verb is then 'squished' into the construction, and the two meanings (verb + construction) are 'fused' By assuming that constructions have meaning, we can overcome a lot of problems with traditional Verb Argument Structure accounts. Problems with traditional Verb Argument Structure accounts \u00b6 1. Valency augmentation \u00b6 We often use sentences with more arguments than the standard valency, e.g. She sneezed the napkin off the table (example above) The naughty students laughed the teacher out of the room She juggled her way to the semi-finals of the juggling contest Can you chop me some carrots? Quote me happy! (Recent advert for insurance) 2. Weird thematic relations \u00b6 There are plenty of verbs which take arguments with 'weird' roles, e.e.g She is happy The table needs a leg That coat suits you The coat fits me She swapped her Porsche for a Ferrari Both a Porsche and a Ferrari can be described as PATIENTS, but this undermines the principle that there is differentiation between the arguments They loaded the truck with hay Is truck a LOCATIVE or a PATIENT? If it is a PATIENT what kind of role does hay play? (assuming that all roles need to be differentiated?) None of these roles can be easily described using standard labels. There is no list of thematic relations which can account for all arguments in English, or indeed any language. This is despite many dozens of attempts by linguists. How constructions solve these issues \u00b6 Goldberg's theory of Verb Argument Structure Constructions \u00b6 Goldberg (1995) proposes that when we use verbs in setnences, we insert them into Verb Argument Structure Constructions (VAS Constructions). These are syntactic units with their own independent meaning . This can help explain both valency augmentation and weird thematic relations : Valency augmentation \u00b6 Here are the two possible solutions: The multiple sense account. We have different senses of verbs in our lexicons, some of which allow extra arguments. e.g. there is a lexical entry for sneeze which allows for three arguments The construction based account. The extra argument is specified by the construction itself. The multiple sense account is highly implausible. Given how rare it is to use sneeze with three arguments, it is very unlikely that we have such a representation in the lexicon. Weird thematic relations \u00b6 If roles are (in part) given by the construction itself, we are not committed to a small and finite set of roles. For example we could posit the following constructions: The copula construction: FORM: X is Y FUNCTION 1: X denotes the same referent as Y (e.g. One man's terrorist is another man's Freedom Fighter) FUNCTION 2: Y describes a property of X (e.g. Die hard is a great Xmas film) FUNCTION 3 (where X and Y are identical): X/Y has a property which is relevant to the current discussion (e.g. It wasn't a great film, but hey, George Clooney is George Clooney) The \"needing\" construction: FORM: X + needing verb + Y FUNCTION: X needs Y (e.g. we're going to need a bigger boat, this task requires a bigger boat, this task necessitates a bigger boat) The fit/suit construction: FORM: X + fit/suit + Y. FUNCTION: X (an item of clothing) looks good on Y (a person) How constructions combine with verbs \u00b6 Fusion \u00b6 But surely the verbs must provide a role as well? Yes, verbs specify roles which are highly specific to that verb , while the VAS Construction specifies roles which are more general . When using a verb with a particular VAS Construction, we need to \"fuse\" the verb-specific role in the former, with the more general role in the latter. What about traditional roles, e.g. \"AGENT\" / \"PATIENT\"? \u00b6 Many of the roles specified by VAS Constructions correspond to widely used traditional labels such as \"AGENT\" and \"PATIENT\", but many do not (e.g. the subject of the copula, or the subject of need ). Some roles appear to be more general than others because they Occur in VAS Constructions with very general/abstract meanings and which allow lots of different verbs, e.g. AGENT + VERB + PATIENT Describe slots with similar meanings in related constructions, e.g. THEME + VERB + EXP. = She scares me, They please George, The play entertained me EXP. + VERB + THEME = I fear her, George likes them, I enjoyed the play The implications of VAS constructions \u00b6 The idea of VAS constructions contradicts with traditional \"words and rules\" approaches to grammar. According to these approaches, words are combined using rules, and then are semantically interpreted, e.g. RULE: VP <- V + NP RULE: Sentence <- NP + VP INTERPRETATION: A situation involving two NPs whose roles are determined by the verb. Late semantic interpretation can be explained by the fact that we always try to identify a meaning as long as the sentence is well formed, e.g. Colourless green ideas sleep furiously Words and rules approaches draw a categorical distinction between syntax (combinatorial rules) and the lexicon (repository of meaning) However, according to Goldberg, syntactic constructions can also be meaningful. This breaks down the distinction between syntax and the lexicon. According to Goldberg, they are all part of the same system. Words involve mapping between form and meaning. Constructions also involve a mapping between form and meaning. Other types of construction (not VAS) \u00b6 Multi-word constructions are everywhere, e.g. You mean, I've got Arthritis Arthritis!!?? FORM: The noun is repeated. MEANING: There is a scale of authenticity ranging from N to N + N (Arthritis to Arthritis Arthritis). N + N (Arthritis Arthritis) is at the high end of this scale. There are burgers, and then there are burgers FORM: There is/are + NP and then there is/are + NP MEANING: There is a scale of authenticity , with the second NP at the top of the scale. Now watch me go and drop this cake! FORM: Now watch + Clause (with nonfinite verb) MEANING: Sometimes called the \" tempting fate \" construction. It means I hope X DOESN'T happen, e.g. I hope I DON'T drop this cake. She worked her way to the top of the class FORM: Subject + Verb + Possessive determiner (his, her, its) + \"way\" + PREPOSITIONAL PHRASE MEANING: X arrived at location Z by means of action Y. Progress is difficult , and the path is circuitous These all display correspondences between form and meaning. The meanings are not predictable from general linguistic rules, i.e. they are non-compositional. Comparing the two models \u00b6 According to the Words and Rules Approach There is a categorical distinction between words (meaning) and rules (form) Linguistic knowledge consists of (a) lexical knowledge, and (b) syntactic knowledge (ability to combine words) Semantic interpretation of a sentence is seperate (and subsequent to) syntactic interpretation According to Construction Grammar accounts Words and syntactic constructions are all part of the same system , sometimes called the \"Constructicon\" Linguistic knowledge = knowledge of constructions (words can be described as \"minimal constructions\") Semantics and syntax are inseparable (as syntactic constructions are meaningful) Problems for construction grammar \u00b6 Some syntactic phenomena do not appear to be linked to meaning, e.g. subject + verb agreement. Clinical implications \u00b6 When teaching children grammatical constructions we need to higlight the meaning of those constructions. E.g. Riches (2013) highlights the meaning of the passive construction (the verb is highly affected), e.g. The vase was smashed by the dog (Vase is highly affected) This is reflected in children's early use of the passive. We very rarely have passives in which the subject is not highly affected, e.g. It was dreamt about. Bibliography \u00b6 Goldberg, A. E. (1995).

Drive Donate Mix Yawn Slap Rain A verb 'begs to be completed into a sentence' (Tomasello, 1992) The verb implies a certain number of participants (Valence) Valence can range from 0 to 3. Psycholinguistic studies demonstrate that even when we hear verbs in isolation we mentally represent the number of participants (e.g. Shapiro et al. 1987 lexical decision task, or Kim & Thomson, 2000) Thematic relations (roles) \u00b6 Look at the following sentences: Jane fears Peter Peter scares Jane Paul liked the play The play pleased Paul Mary gave Pete a present Pete received a present from Mary We can see that in order to use a verb properly, knowing the valence is not enough. We need to know which roles come in which positions. Otherwise we will get the meaning of the sentence wrong, e.g. we will say Jane scares Peter .

We can test for obligatoriness by omitting an presumed argument, and seeing how this impacts on grammaticality She dropped the pen She took the jacket But most arguments can be rendered optional in certain contexts She give $[$ money $]$ to charity They all gave presents to Mary. Paul gave a pen (to Mary), Jenny gave a book (to Mary), and Brad gave a watch (to Mary) COOKING INSTRUCTIONS: Chop (the carrots) and stir (them) into the sauce So obligatoriness will only get you so far! In addition, some verbs seem to elicit a wide variety of arguments $[$ He $]$ paints $[$ walls $]$ $[$ He $]$ painted $[$ the wall $]$ $[$ red $]$ $[$ He $]$ painted $[$ the wall $]$ $[$ red $]$ $[$ with a paintbrush $]$ and $[$ some paint $]$ $[$ This brush $]$ paints well There are many potential arguments. Which ones are essential? Finally sometimes verbs can take \"extra-valent\" arguments which sound \"added on\" She swam $[$ ten lengths $]$ They laughed $[$ the teacher $]$ $[$ out of the room $]$ There is no foolproof way to determine valency Method 1: Work out which arguments are \"nearly\" obligatory by looking at at a corpus Method 2: Introspection. Shut your eyes and imagine the verb. How many entities are in the mental scene you have just conjured. These two methods can occasionally give different results! So there is no knock down method. If in doubt, shut your eyes, and click your heels together! Do we need argument structure? \u00b6 Why not just assume that the way we use words in sentences is a direct result of their meanings? This approach is sometimes described as a projectionist approach. 2 problems: Examples above ( Jane fears Peter / Peter scares Jane ) suggest that each verb must specify the order of the roles. A syntactic level of representation is arguably required for this, as we can't work out the order of arguments from the verb meaning ( fear and scare arguably convey the same situation, with the only difference being the order of arguments) Verbs specify detailed information about sentence structure which is not obviously linked to their meaning, e.g. say versus tell have almost identical meanings, but are used in sentences in very different ways: Say Tell VERB + NOUN PHRASE He said his name X VERB + CLAUSE (mini sentence) He said [that he was hungry] X VERB + NOUN PHRASE + CLAUSE X He told his friend that he was angry These meanings can be \"boiled down\" to a difference in argument structure (or more specifically valency ). The main difference appears to be that say takes 2 arguments, while tell takes 3 arguments. Verbs with very similar meanings have very different argument structure configurations, e.g. He gave a book to Mary / He gave her the book He donated a book to the library / *He donated the library a book If we were just inferring a verb's syntactic behaviour from its meaning, we would have no way to account for this. (NB it's not sure how argument structure can account for this either) Propositions \u00b6 The verb and its arguments from a proposition . A proposition is a mental scene involving at least one participant (or argument) participating in an event or situation (expressed by the verb, or \"predicate\") A proposition contains those entities which make the most important contributions to the truth conditions of the sentence (the real world conditions under which the sentence is true). Nouns (arguments) and verbs make a major contribution to truth conditions, e.g. The dog chased the cat -> The robot washed the cat: TRUTH CONDITIONS HAVE COMPLETELY CHANGED The dog chased the cat -> The dog quickly chased a cat: MINOR CHANGE TO TRUTH CONDITIONS Propositions come at the bottom of a three way heirarchy: Propositional level chase(dog,cat) Sentence level a. The dog chased the cat b. It chased the cat c. The cat was chased by the dog Utterance level A: Is your dog energetic? B: Well, it chases the neighbour's cat every day! We need propositions to explain how different surface forms (e.g. 2) can have the same underlying meaning. The proposition IS the underlying meaning. Thematic relations (roles) \u00b6 Researchers have proposed that the roles given by verbs are universal (i.e. found across languages), and finite (i.e. there are a small set of them). Main roles for Noun Phrases \u00b6 The main roles for Noun Phrases are AGENT , PATIENT , EXPERIENCER and THEME Test AGENT PATIENT EXPERIENCER THEME Does entity deliberately initate the action? Can we say 'what X did was Y...' Yes No No No Is entity affected? Cann we say 'what happend to X was...' Yes Yes No Is entity affected physically? Yes No NB this table should be read as a decision tree. Try to determine the thematic relations of the Noun Phrases in the following sentences: Charles crashed the car Mavis heard the noise The noise startled Mavis The tree fell down in the storm Ali considered the exciting proposal Fatimah hated the start of term The swing broke under his weight The doctor felt the patient's foot I like having a bath with my clothes on Jack liked Susan's holiday snaps on Facebook. Other roles for Noun Phrases \u00b6 Benefactive is the role typically given to Indirect Object Noun Phrases, e.g. She gave $[$ him $ {BEN.}$ $]$ $[$ a book $ {PAT.}$ $]$ She bought $[$ a book $ {PAT.}$ $]$ $[$ for him $ {BEN.}$ $]$ Possessor is the owner of something $[$ Jack $_{POSS.}$ $]$ has/owns a Ferrari The house belongs to $[$ Martha $_{POSS.}$ $]$ Roles for other types of phrases \u00b6 Attributives \u00b6 Phrases which describe a property of something else are called ATTRIBUTIVES, e.g. Janice feels happy $_{ATTR}$ Losing at bingo makes Martha sad $_{ATTR}$ Jack is in a mood $_{ATTR}$ We can often make questions about attributives using the question word how , e.g. Q: How does janice feel? A: Happy ATTRIBUTIVES are mapped to Subject and Object Complements (Cs, Co) Locatives \u00b6 Phrases which describe locations are sometimes called LOCATIVES, e.g. Jason is in the park $_{LOC}$ Pat loaded the hay onto the wagon $_{LOC}$ But be careful for a LOCATIVE to be a genuine argument, it has to be selected by the verb. In the following sentences The girls played baseball in the park the phrase in the park is not technically an argument because it is not chosen by the verb. However, researchers and clinicians have a tendency to label these non-arguments as arguments! How completely sloppy! We can make questions about locatives using the question word where , e.g. Q: Where is Jason? A: In the park. Instruments \u00b6 An instrument is an object used to perform and action, e.g. Angela covered the food with a cloth $_{INSTR}$ This is actually a dubious candidate for a genuine thematic relation. If a verb requires a specific instrument, the instrument is often made explicit in the verb, e.g. He hammered the nail (with a hammer) She filed her nails (with a nail file). If a verb does not require a specific instrument, it is expressed using with , e.g. He scratched his back with a loofah This is arguably not an essential participant in the scratching action, and this kind of phrase is always omissible. So it probably shouldn't be categorised as an argumnet (but many people do!)
