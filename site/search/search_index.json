This effect is called the \u201ctesting effect\u201d, and a learning strategy which depends on continually testing yourself is called \u201ctest-enhanced\u201d learning. Amazingly, there is good evidence that the very act of testing yourself is beneficial, even if you do not successfully recall the relevant information (Kornell et al., 2015; Kornell & Vaughn, 2016; Vaughn et al., 2017). This is pretty extraordinary and suggests that time spent studying at your desk is never wasted, even if you are struggling to recall the material. The way that you test yourself depends on the material you are learning. For example, if testing new words in a foreign language you could have a card with the word in your first language (e.g. English) on one side, and the word in the target language (e.g. French) on the other side. You can work your way through the pack, read the English word, try to recall the French word, and test your knowledge by turning over the card. You could also do this process in reverse, e.g. look at the French word, and try to translate this into English. The more active we are in the way we test ourselves, the better we learn and retain the information. Regarding the flashcard example above, the more active form of learning is to read the English word, and try to recall the French word. However, though the alternative process, translating from French to English is less active, it may be beneficial in certain contexts, e.g. for quick revision. Some forms of learning are much more abstract not amenable to flashcards. An example of this is your understanding of the word class Noun. You could revise this in a variety of ways, e.g. - Provide a definition , but with a word missing, e.g. A Noun is word which often refers to a ___ (thing). It is often preceded by a ___ (Determiner) - Create a multiple choice question , e.g. In the following sentence, which of the following properties does not describe a Noun It takes the suffix -ing \u2714 It takes the suffix -s (in the regular form) It is often prceded by a detrminer - Create an open-ended \u201clist\u201d question , e.g. \u201cList three properties of a Noun\u201d (Possible answers: it tends to refer to a thing, it inflects for plural, e.g. horses , it comes after a determiner, e.g. the horse , it \u201cagrees\u201d with a verb, e.g. the horse runs, the horses run_ etc.) - Create a completely open-ended question , e.g. \u201cWhat is a definition of a noun\u201d? Which of these you think promotes more active learning? Evidence suggests that the more open-ended questions lead to better learning because they involve active recall of the material rather than recognition of the right answer (Kang et al., 2007). This doesn\u2019t mean that multiple-choice questions are bad for study \u2013 they can be very beneficial. For example, there are clear right or wrong answers, unlike open-ended questions, and this can help you decide whether you need to revise a particular topic. They are also less time-consuming than open-ended questions. A good revision strategy would probably contain a mix of different types of revision prompts, e.g. flashcards, multiple-choice questions, open-ended list questions, and completely open-ended questions. Why note-taking is a key skill \u00b6 Words are concrete and easy to test using flashcard systems. For other kinds of knowledge, e.g. abstract theories, flashcards are too crude and simplistic, so you\u2019ll need to find other ways to test yourself. For example, you could write the key claims of the theory on a piece of paper, number these, and using the numbers as prompts try to recall each claim one by one. This kind of works, but it is clear that the more abstract and complex a knowledge domain becomes, the more difficult it is to think of ways to test yourself. While you are thinking about clever procedures to test yourself on everything you need to know, just start taking some notes. Take a blank sheet of paper, or open up a note-taking app, and try to recall everything you need to know in note form. By taking notes you are having to actively recall and process the information you have learnt. For example, because you are incapable of rapidly writing down everything the lecturer says (unless you are a word-record typist or short-hand expert), you are having to identify the most important points when notetaking. Also, because human memory for linguistic form is generally weaker than our memory for linguistic meaning, you will have to write down the main points of the lecture in your own words, and in this way you are having to actively process the information. An additional benefit of note-taking is that you can easily show the structure of the material you are learning using headings and subheadings. All of the material you learn will have some kind of structure, e.g. a theory might consist of three key arguments, and the ICF clinical framework consists of four areas of functioning. Lectures themselves will be organised into discrete sections. Moreover, there is evidence to suggest that information is more adequately processed and retained when it is explicitly integrated into a larger structure. For example the regular use of headings and subheadings in written passages helps the reader to read more quickly and accurately, and recall more information (Hy\u00f6n\u00e4 & Lorch, 2004; Lorch & Lorch, 1996; Sanchez et al., 2001). However, while the information you are given fits into an overarching structure, the technology which is used to deliver lectures is not great for showing structure. Powerpoint does not show structure very well, as it invites the user to create a continuous chain of slides. Sometimes lecturers add \u201cTable of Contents\u201d slides, but this is not that widely practised. By making notes you can actually impose structure on the material you are learning, using headings and subheadings, and this will help you to learn that material. The Cornell note-taking system \u00b6 A good tried and tested note-taking system is called \u201cCornell Notes\u201d, which was devised by Prof. Walter Pauk of Cornell University in the 1950s. If you do an internet search you will find loads of materials on this approach. Here is one link to start you off. Why writing notes on slides may not be helpful \u00b6 Lecturers often supply their students with handouts containing the slides. Many students write on these handouts, and believe that this is an appropriate way to learn. But what is the evidence that this is a good learning approach? Existing studies investigating the impact of slide-based handouts have found that students learn better without them (Kim, 2018; Worthington & Levasseur, 2015). Why might this be the case? Firstly, if the slides contain a substantial amount of text, you are less likely to convert what you have learnt into your own words. Your notes will become shorter. They will become comments on the slides, rather than a full paraphrase of what you have just heard. Consequently, you will be learning in a more passive manner. Secondly, as mentioned above, it is quite difficult to signpost structure within slides. By contrast, if you make notes on a blank piece of paper it is easier to show structure by writing your own subheadings. So, I just need to make good notes? \u00b6 Yes, good note-taking is the place to start, but you also need to explore other ways to test yourself. As mentioned, flashcards may be very useful. For example, for anatomy, you could have a picture of a part of the body on one side, and the label on the other. You can look at the picture, and then attempt to recall the label. If you are correct, put it in the correct pile, and if you are incorrect, or cannot recall it, put it in the incorrect pile. There is quite interesting evidence to suggest that if you correctly recall something once, you are likely to recall it successfully in the future (Bahrick et al., 1993). Therefore, you can learn very efficiently just by repeatedly testing yourself on the items in the incorrect pile. Also, make sure that, when you test yourself, you do it at fairly widely-spaced intervals. This principle is known as \u201cdistributed learning\u201d or the \u201cspacing effect\u201d, and there is a lot of evidence that it is beneficial for learning in an academic setting (Dempster, 1988). Naturally, flashcards are only amenable to certain kinds of topics. For more abstract topics (e.g. Linguistics, Psychology), and you will need to find other ways to test yourself, e.g. by creating your own questions / prompts. What to do with all this technology? \u00b6 There is a whole host of technology out there for you to explore when it comes to taking notes, or creating flashcards. Below I have described a few apps that I am aware of, but there must be many more out there that I\u2019ve missed; Note-taking \u00b6 OneNote \u2013 this has the advantage that it integrates well with other Microsoft products, e.g. emailing, calendar, and Teams Notion (https://www.notion.so) \u2013 possibly the most widely used non-Microsoft note-taking app. It\u2019s also great as a general organisational app. Its basic plan is free. Roam Research (https://roamresearch.com) \u2013 High-concept, and slightly geeky app, frequently touted as \u201cthe next big thing\u201d. It\u2019s online only, and expensive, but students can get free plans. Evernote (https://evernote.com) \u2013 Simple app, which works both online and locally Apple Notes - If you are an Apple afficionado. Flashcards \u00b6 Quizlet (https://quizlet.com/en-gb) \u2013 online flashcard app. Anki (https://apps.ankiweb.net) \u2013 open source cross-platform flashcard app. It has a bit of a steep learning curve. All-in-one technologies \u00b6 These are technologies which incorporate note-taking and flashcards in a single app. The idea is that you can use them to take notes, and quickly generate flashcards to test yourself. Remnote (https://www.remnote.com) \u2013 Very user-friendly, online but also with a local app. It is explicitly designed for students. However, make sure you regularly back up your data to your local computer and don\u2019t leave it sitting in the cloud (Remnote provides an easy way to do this). Obsidian - (https://obsidian.md) - Very popular note-taking app with revision features incorporated via plugins. Logseq (https://logseq.com) \u2013 Wonderful open-source notetaking and general organisational app. However, the learning curve is steeper than remnote. A big advantage is that you have complete ownership of your data. Roam Research \u2013 As mentioned above. Roam also has good tools for creating question banks. Further reading \u00b6 \u201cMake it stick: the science of succesful learning\u201d (Brown, Roediger III, McDaniel) is a popular science book written by leading experts in the field which covers many of the above ideas, e.g. test-enhanced learning, distributed practice. The website which accompanies the book (https://www.retrievalpractice.org/make-it-stick) also contains lots of really cool infographics to demonstrate the main ideas. Check it out!

How are word meanings combined to form sentence meanings? What is pragmatics \u00b6 The study of language in context A: Do you want to see Mission Impossible V? B: I don't like action movies. Interpretation 'no thanks' is only derivable if sentence is produced in the appropriate context What is phonology? \u00b6 Ask Ghada and Jalal!! Crossing over \u00b6 While it is tempting to think in neat subfields, many phenomena cross over e.g. The meaning of verbs (semantics) determines the number of participants in a sentence, which in turn determines the structure (syntax). John [1] gave Mary [2] a book [3] Because of these cross-over phenomena, linguists often talk about the 'interfaces' between the different subdomains, e.g. the syntax-semantic interface. Subfields of linguistics \u00b6 Theoretical linguistics : investigates the nature of linguistic knowledge. IMPORTANT QUESTIONS: Are we born with knowledge of language? How do we explain similarities and differences across languages? Psycholinguistics : investigates how we comprehend and produce language. IMPORTANT QUESTIONS: Is the human mind similar to desktop computer? Does the language we speak affect the way we think? Sociolinguistics : investigates how and why language varies across different social classes and groupings. E.g. William Labov's famous (1963) study of Martha's Vinyard. He studies centralisation of diphthongs (multi-sound vowels). He pioneered methods to elicit relevant words without using word lists. He found an association between self-identification as a native and use of centralisation. Centralisation increased in response to an influx of non-natives. This shows that the language we use \"indexes\" our social identity. Discourse studies : How we use language to persuade / exert power relationships. Approaches to language structure \u00b6 Prescriptive grammars - how we SHOULD speak \u00b6 Prescriptive judgements regarding language usage are periodically proposed by influential individuals. Key targets of prescriptive judgements are the double negative and use of innit as a tage question. Linguists would not regard either of these forms as \"bad\" English. The key thing is that they are (a) shared among a speech community (b) adequately convey a message, i.e. do not lead to ambiguity and misunderstanding. (1) Double negative : I haven't got no money / I can't get no satisfaction Acceptable in certain dialects (e.g. London English) and languages (e.g. Spanish). It does not cause confusion as many prescriptivists claim. (2) Use of innit as a tag question It was a great meal, wasn't it / innit ? You're Jack's nephew, aren't you / innit ? They've been to Greece, haven't they / innit? This simplifies tag questions, but why is that a bad thing? Many languages create tag questions using single morphemes, e.g. Bengali kanna . (3) African-American Vernacular English : He be working Tuesdays (he is usually working on a Tuesday) He been got a job (he got a job a long time ago) It grammaticalises concepts which are not grammaticalised in Standard English. Therefore it is RICHER (with regard to certain grammatical subsystems). So how do prescriptive grammars arise? They reflect the dominant dialect in the country, which in turn is a consequence of which regions hold the most political and economic power. As Weinreich said 'A language is a dialect with an army and a navy' Descriptive grammars - how we ACTUALLY speak \u00b6 Geordie English: No plural suffix for nouns denoting a time period, e.g. I've been here three year. Scottish English: Use of amn't I ? as a tag question, e.g. I'm next in line, amn't I ? Mental grammars - the underlying system \u00b6 Which of these sentences is correct? Me and Jack went to the shops I and Jack went to the shops Jack and me went to the shops Jack and I went to the shops Now which is the way you actually say the sentence? Note that there is a conflict between prescriptive and mental grammars. Individuals who allow prescriptive grammars to override mental grammars are guilty of 'hypercorrection' Hypercorrection \u00b6 This is a phenomena whereby we override our mental grammar, and instead adopt a prescriptive grammar. Our natural tendency is to say Me and Jack went to the shops . This is our mental grammar . However, in certain formal contexts, we may say Jack and I went to the shops , which is often prescribed at school. Hypercorrection is interesting because it shows that prescriptive grammar has a lot of power over us. A communicative view of language \u00b6 Definition \u00b6 (1) Language is primarily a form a communication and all linguistic 'rules' subserve this goal (2) Linguistic 'rules' are established by speech communities (3) A sentence is 'well-formed' if it reliably expresses the speaker's thoughts using forms which are 'conventionalised', i.e. shared by the speaker's speech community. Relationship with SLT practice \u00b6 When assessing children we should evaluate their language according to the norms of their speech community For example, deviations from the target when scoring sentence repetition which are consistent with the speaker's dialect are not scored as an error. \"The Influence of Linguistic Bias Upon Speech-Language Pathologists\u2019 Attitudes Toward Clinical Scenarios Involving Nonstandard Dialects of English\", Easton and Verdon, 2020 Therapists were given dialect-related clinical scenarios, and needed to make clinical judgements Length of experience was correlated with more careful clinical judgements Positive attitudes to dialect difference were correlated with more careful clinical judgements. 5-minute exercise \u00b6 What is the grammatical word class (e.g. noun, verb, adjective etc.) of the italicised words in the following sentences: The raging river tore through the valley That film really sucks","title":"01 - Introduction"},{"location":"lecture%20notes/01%20-%20introduction/#01-introduction","text":"","title":"01 - Introduction"},{"location":"lecture%20notes/01%20-%20introduction/#introduction","text":"","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"lecture%20notes/01%20-%20introduction/#why-slts-need-to-know-about-linguistics","text":"Is a child who says Him go there language impaired?

Different dictionaries will list nighttime , night-time or night time . So conventions are fairly arbitrary. Something which are multiple words on a page, actually behave semantically like a single word e.g. He has a lot of joie de vivre Definition \u00b6 Working definition is 'Minimal Independent Symbolic Unit' (MISU) Minimal \u00b6 A \"minimal\" unit = we cannot split it into smaller pieces. Inactive -> * One sip of coffee and Charles changes from in- to hyper- active**. Underconfident -> ?After eight pints, Angela changes from under- to over- confident . Walk out -> She walked through the door and out of my life. Blackbird (species) -> * She saw a black and a white bird** in the tree Black magic -> ?The witch practises both black and white magic Independent \u00b6 This property can be defined in a couple of ways: (a) Words are interpretable in isolation. They may \"stand alone\". A: What was he doing? B: Working B: How would you describe the experience? B: Unbelievable Shark!!!!!!!! Swim!!!!!!!!! (b) Words can move around the sentence, e.g. The dog chased the cat The cat chased the dog He loves being with his dog Symbolic \u00b6 This means that there is an arbitrary relationship between form and function (or sound and meaning ) To test this, we can take a single concept, and look at words to describe this concept across languages. The words will have very different sound properties. The property of symbolism was listed by the linguist Charles Sanders Pierce (1839 - 194) as a key defining property of human languages A dirty secret - there is no adequate definition of a word \u00b6 All of the properties which are used to define a word: minimality, independence, and symbolism, are in fact gradable. For example black magic is weakly minimal as when the two units are separate it sounds ever so slightly odd, e.g. ?The witch practises both black and white magic Independence is also highly gradable. Both mood and tizz occur with similar meanings in the phrase, He is in a mood / tizz . But only mood can easily move around a sentence, e.g. His mood was dark . Moroever, if someone were to say tizz in isolation and ask you if it's a word you might find this difficult. You would probably say \"yes\" on the basis that it occurs in the phrase in a tizz but you would need to think carefully about this. Some types of word classes lack independence, e.g. determiners such as the . Finally, symbolism is also gradient. There is lots of interesting work demonstrating that sound symbolism is quite widespread in the world's languages. For example, across languages the word for `tongue' often contains /l/ (Blasi et al., 2016). So when in clinic you are analysing a sentence, and you're deciding to determine whether a lexical unit is a real word, there may not be a perfect yes/no answer! Word classes \u00b6 Words belong to word classes / syntactic categories The word class determines how we put words together to make sentences Semantic definitions - why the don't work very well \u00b6 Typical examples: A verb is a DOING word An adjective is a DESCRIBING word But are the following adjectives or verbs? The raging river tore through the valley That film really sucks These examples demonstrate that semantic/functional definitions of words fall short 3 ways to define word classes \u00b6 (a) Semantics / meaning-based test, e.g. a verb is a 'doing' word. (b) Morphological test, e.g. we can make a verb progressive by adding -ing (c) Positional test, e.g. verbs come after subjects and before objects, e.g. she ate the fish , she likes cheese . So which test? \u00b6 The positional test is the most reliable, e.g. The raging river tore through the valley: raging comes before a noun. It is an adjective That film really sucks : comes after the subject film . It is a verb. Let's meet the word classes! \u00b6 Categorization of word classes \u00b6 Content versus function words Content words = Nouns, Verbs, Adjectives, Adverbs (in Speech and Language Therapy, these are sometimes called 'information-carrying words') Function words = Determiners, Pronouns, Prepositions (and maybe certain types of verbs, we will come to this later) Open versus closed class. Open class words permit new members, while closed class words don't. NB all content words are open, and all function words are closed. Open = Nouns, Verbs, Adjectives, Adverbs Closed = Determiners, Pronouns, Prepositions. What the words do in the sentence? Referring words = Nouns, Pronouns Modifying words = Adjectives and Adverbs Where do they appear in the sentence? The verb complex tends to contain auxiliary verbs and adverbs in addition to the verb itself The Noun Phrase tends to contain determiners and adjectives in addition to the noun itself Prepositions are used before the Noun Phrase. Super- and sub-types Types of modifying words: adjectives and adverbs Types of referring words (nominals): Nouns and Pronouns Word classes and language impairment \u00b6 Children with language impairments Tend to miss out function words Have difficulties understanding prepositions (when used to express location), e.g. on , in Have reduced verb diversity Sometimes omit arguments of the verb, e.g. 'She put the books' 5 minutes exercise \u00b6 What's unusual about the following sentence: \"That film was absobloodylutely brilliant!\"? A student says 'I am going to a lection'. What does 'lection' mean, and how has this error arisen? Bibliography \u00b6 Blasi, D. E., Wichmann, S., Hammarstrom, H., Stadler, P.

Tree is a hyponym / subordinate of Plant Plant is a hyperonym / superordinate of Tree Mid-level categories are (a) more rapidly named, (b) more easily visualised, (c) acquired earlier Words which exist at the same level are called co-hyponyms or coordinates , e.g. daisy, begonia, Tulip / flower, bush, tree / chair, sofa, wardrobe. Synonmy \u00b6 'Syn' = together, 'nym' = name/word Words with identical meanings. Very few genuine synonyms. When words are identical in denotation (event or thing they refer to), they differ in connotation (set of associations they trigger), e.g. chap / bloke / geezer (who would you buy a used car from?) , fiesta / knees up / bash / soir\u00e9e (which would you prefer to go to?) There are very few genuine synonyms, i.e. where denotation and connotation are teh same. Some examples are words differing across dialects or varieties of a language, e.g. tap / fawcett, pavement / sidewalk , and some grammatical words, e.g. however / nonetheless Antonmy \u00b6 'Anto' = opposite, 'nym' = name/word Words with opposite meanings. Can be gradable (e.g. slightly hot , very cold ) or non-gradable (e.g. * very dead ) Sometimes there is no obvious opposite, e.g. the opposite of virgin . There is a 'lexical gap' Homonymy \u00b6 'Homo' = same, 'nym' = name/word. Same form, but no obvious meaning relationship. Words have similar forms due to ' historical accident '. May have same root (in which case there is a tenuous meaning relationship), e.g. a table of numbers, versus the kitchen table Or may have a different root, e.g. bay tree [LATIN baca], the ship entered the bay [OLD FRENCH baie], the dogs bayed [OLD FRENCH abai]. The fact that these words, with different an unrelated meanings, have the same pronunciation is a historical accident. Polysemy \u00b6 'Poly' = multiple, 'sem' = meaning. Same form, and different but related meanings. The meaning relationship is mentally represented Prepositions are notoriously polysemous, e.g. over = straight movement in contact with a plane, e.g. he ran over the field , or over = two dimensional movement across a bounded plane, e.g. the balloon floated over the city (or possibly there is no movement at all), or over = random movement covering a plane_, e.g. he poured ketchup over the chips_. Other polysemous words; He went to bed , a river- bed , flower bed , the steak was served on a bed of lettuce The cup was full , the room was full , she has a full schedule, she leads a full life. Are meaning relationships systematic or random? According to Charles Fillmore (e.g. Fillmore & Atkins, 2000), there is a central sense, with all meanings radiating from this central sense, e.g. all meanings of over share the idea that the 'figure' (smaller object) is, at some stage, above the 'ground' (larger object). All meanings of bed involve a flat surface made of a relatively soft material. When teaching a polysemous word, it may be best to start with the central meaning (or 'sense') of the word, and later teach the more peripheral meanings (e.g. Tyler & Evans, 2004) Homonyms versus Polysemes \u00b6 Both describe words with same form, but different meanings. The only difference is whether the meaning relationship is mentally represented . Moreover, according to Fillmore's approach meaning relationships among polysemous words are structure / systematic. The only way to test this is via personal intuition. Lexical gaps \u00b6 A language lacks a word where there should be one. Easily demonstrated with antonyms Opposite of bald? Opposite of virgin? Many English kinship terms are vague, e.g. English cousin can be used for a variety of different relations, while Sudanese has different words for every type of cousin. Loan words, e.g. kitsch & schadenfreude , are used to fill lexical gaps. A recent load word is hygge . Form-related relationships \u00b6 Homophony \u00b6 Same spoken form, different written forms (with different meanings) e.g. might / mite, leak / leek Homography \u00b6 Same written form, different spoken forms (with different meanings) e.g. bow, minute Exploring semantic networks \u00b6 Word association norms A says a word, and B says the first word that comes into their heads Coordinates are the most frequent category, e.g. if the prime is cat , the participant says dog . Next are collocations (words which tend to co-occur, e.g. fish and chips , cats and dogs ). Then come superordinates, e.g. cat primes pet , and finally subordinates ( cat primes Siamese ). Word association tasks conducted with children with Developmental Language Impairments find tentative evidence for reduced semantic networks, e.g. large number of responses which are very odd, e.g. Spoon -> Disney, or based on phonological similarity, e.g. cow -> how (Sheng & McGregor, 2010) Semantic fluency tasks A asks B to say as many words as possible from a single category, e.g. animals, things you take on holidays. When asked to list animals, a typical response might be Dog, cat, rabbit -- lion, tiger -- fish, whale, dolphin Responses tend to be grouped into clusters, e.g. the above response contains a DOMESTIC ANIMAL cluster, then a WILD ANIMAL cluster, then a SEA MAMMAL cluster. Poorer semantic fluency in developmental language disorders and autism (Kail & Leonard, 1986; Bishop & Norbury, 2005). For example, they produce fewer words and clusters Some have suggested that semantic fluency tasks can be used to predict onset of Alzheimmers: few clusters, cluster members and switches between clusters (Gomez & White, 2006) Lexical priming task e.g. does hearing word X spead up recognition / recall of word Y?

INFLECTIONAL morphemes participate in phonological processes to a greater extent than DERIVATIONAL morphemes While INFLECTIONAL morphemes are very productive (we can add them to many words), DERIVATIONAL morphemes are less productive. While DERIVATIONAL morphemes can come at the beginning and ends of words (prefixes and suffixes), INFLECTIONAL morphemes can only come at the end (suffix) Other differences: (1) Derivational morphemes are longer (2) Derivational morphemes have more specific meanings, e.g. out in outmaneouvre means \"to do something better than a competitor\" (3) Derivational morphemes are more language-specific, e.g. out- prefix is not found in Spanish, and -ito/-illo diminutive suffixes are not used productively in English.

Morphemes and language impairment \u00b6 Individuals with language impairment struggle with inflectional morphemes. In particular, children with Developmental Language Disorder (DLD) often miss out tense morphemes, e.g. regular past tense. Many studies quantify children's language abilities using the Mean Length of Utterance in Morphemes. Language-impaired individuals tend to have difficulties using derivational morphemes.

It is worthwhile teaching these morphemes in clinic as they can be used to build words.","title":"Morphemes and language impairment"},{"location":"lecture%20notes/04%20-%20Words%20versus%20morphemes/#5-minute-exercise","text":"Look at these examples.

For example reaction times indicate that we parse pseudo-inflections, e.g. mil d (potentially past tense of the verb to mile ) as actual inflections. Words with regular inflectional affixes tend to be phonotactically irregular (e.g. irregular lost rhymes with frost , but regular turned does not rhyme with any other monomorphemic word). This suggests they are not stored. Evidence of the whole-word storage of morphologically-complex words \u00b6 Some complex forms contain non-word roots , indicating that they haven't been built up compositionally, e.g. Un remitt ingly It's in evit able The food supplies were de plete d Some morphemes have multiple meanings, e.g. -er = AGENT, e.g. gardener , or INSTRUMENT, e.g. paint stripper . If words are built up compositionally, how do we know which meaning of -er to select? Psycholinguistic evidence indicates that some morphologically-complex forms are stored as wholes, e.g. Loscewicz (1995) found that inflections in high-frequency inflected forms were significantly shorter than in low-frequency inflected forms -> high-frequency forms were stored as a whole. Alegre and Gordon (1999) found a relationship between whole-word frequency and performance on a nonword discrimination task when whole-word frequency exceeded 1 per 7 million. A hybrid view \u00b6 There is strong evidence for both computational and whole word accounts. Novel inflected forms, e.g. meek ed , must be generated by adding the morpheme. Words with non-word roots, e.g. unre mitt ingly clearly cannot be generated compositionally. So we have two possible** routes to creating morphologically-complex words. High frequency morphologically complex forms are stored in the lexicon Lower frequency forms are generated by computational processes This reflects a trade-off between speed of processing, and expressivity. Whole-word storage of morphologically complex forms -> rapid processing. Separate storage of morphemes allows coining of novel morphologically complex forms, e.g. meek ed **. Pronunciation of mouth in Plymouth versus Cockermouth may reflect two systems (high frequency form, stored as a whole, involves schwa sounds (neutral vowel) The binary view may be too simple. Aitchison (2002) suggests a variety of different levels of storage. For example, the semantic transparency of morphemes (how interpretable they are) exhibits gradient properties. Fogglemouth = This is an imaginary town lying at the mouth of the river 'Foggle'. Suffix -mouth is fully transparent. It is applied using a productive rule > Grangemouth = A real town, but for those outside the Cumbria, this is likely to be a low-frequency word. It may be stored as a whole. Suffix -mouth is less transparent than the -mouth in Fogglemouth > Plymouth = High frquency word stored as unanalysed whole. Suffix mouth is less transparent than in Grangemouth . chickenless (FULLY PRODUCTIVE / TRANSPARENT) > careless (PARTIALLY PRODUCTIVE / TRANSPARENT) > gormless, ruthless (NOT PRODUCTIVE / TRANSPARENT) For chickenless , both morphemes are semantically transparen. The word looks derived. For careless , the morphemes are transparent, but we are likely to store and process the word as a whole. Finally, in gormless and ruthless the roots are not semantically transparent. Morphology in language impairments - Ullman and Pinker's Dual Route model \u00b6 Ullman and Pinker explain language difficulties in terms of the computational and lexical systems, and also give it a neuropsychological grounding. The computational system is governed by procedural memory (involved in the acquisition of unconscious, implicit routines), while the lexical system resides in declarative memory . In particular, they focus on verbs Irregular forms are stored as wholes in the lexicon Regular forms are generated via the computational system (NB Pinker and Ullman accept that high-frequency inflected forms may be stored in the lexicon) The two systems compete with each other under time pressure. If an irregular form is found, the computational process is blocked. If the irregular form is not found, the computational process takes over. Evidence: Frequency effects are only found in the irregular system only Children's overregularisation errors, e.g. she swammed are determined by the density of the irregular neighbourhood which the irregular root belongs to. Adult generation of inflected form is affected by input frequency only in the irregular system. Difficulties with regular forms are linked to impaired procedural memory Children with Developmental Language Disorder Adults with Parkinsons Adults with Broca's-type aphasia Difficulties with irregular forms are linked to impaired declarative memory Adults with Anomia Adults with Wernicke's type aphasia Criticism of the dual route model \u00b6 (1) Pseudo-regularity (irregular forms exhibit characteristics of regular forms) \u00b6 Irregulars exhibit characteristics of the regular system, e.g. verbs already ending in an alveolar plosive are more likely to be irregular, e.g. meet -> met, let -> let, put -> put, shut -> meet -> met , and nouns already ending in -s are more likely to take irregular plurals, e.g. goose -> geese, mouse -> mice, moose -> moose . This has led some researchers to argue that there are not two completely separate systems for regular and irregular forms, e.g. Joanisse and Seidenberg (1999) (2) The role of frequency \u00b6 The Dual Route model argues that frequency effects are characteristic of the lexical/declarative system, but not the computational system. Nonetheless, frequency effects also characterise the regular system (e.g. Losiewicz and Alegre & Gordon studies cited above) 5-minute exercise \u00b6 Which one of these sentences did Yoda say in the Star Wars trilogy?

PRESENT TENSE: At the moment of speaking, the speaker likes cheese. She ate an apple. PAST TENSE: The eating event occurred BEFORE the moment of speaking. English has two morphological tenses (i.e. marked by verb endings): the past and the present. The future is not morphologically marked, but is expressed in a variety of different ways. \"will\" future: I'll help you to carry that shopping. \"going to\" future: I think I'm going to be sick. \"about to\" future: I am about to be sick PRESENT TENSE as future: The train leaves at 6.15 PRESENT PROGRESSIVE as future: We're leaving at 10am. These forms for expressing the future are generally not described as tenses because They are not morphological forms (i.e. they involve more than verb endings) They express meanings above and beyond the future. For example.... \"will\" is used for OFFERS and PREDICTIONS I'll help you with that bag I think it will rain tomorrow \"going to\" is used to talk about the FUTURE BASED ON CURRENT EVIDENCE, or PLANS I think I'm going to be sick (because I feel nauseous) I'm going to apply for a Speech and Language Therapy course PRESENT TENSE is used for a TIMETABLED FUTURE The train leaves at 6.15 PRESENT PROGRESSIVE is used for a FUTURE ARRANGEMENT I'm studying Speech and Language Therapy next year (I already have a place on a course) \"be about to\" is for the NEAR FUTURE The players are warming up. The match is about to begin. Because future forms in English are not strictly tenses, we are going to refer to the \"future tense\" in inverted commas. Next week, we're going to be looking at the syntax/morphology of tense in more detail. Aspect \u00b6 Inherent temporal properties of events \u00b6 Zoetrope - a victorian parlour toy designed to create a moving image (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hE_fA9M580&t=1m18s) Which of the following verbs would make a good zoetrope? swim crash laugh dive pop dance exist For a verb to work in zoetrope it needs (a) 'internal structure' (b) no definite end point, e.g. running, walking, swimming. We can see that certain verbs have particular temporal properties. These properties are referred to as \"lexical aspect\" (sometimes called \"aktionsarten\") ### (a) States versus non-states \u00b6 States are abstract, and do not have \"internal structure\" (e.g. \"existing\" doesnt' vary in any way across time, while when you are running, different snapshots will show your arms and legs in completely different positions). Non-states have internal structure. Examples of states are \"existing verbs\", be, live, exist, \"experiencer-theme verbs\", e.g. like, love, hate , and mental state verbs, e.g. believe, know, hope . Tests... Because they are abstract they are difficult to define. E.g. you can give a good definition of run , but try to give a definition of exist , or like State verbs sound odd in the progressive (-ing form), e.g. ?? she is existing, ??she is liking the food, ??I am believing in fairies . This is becuase the progressive places us inside the event, and this is difficult to do when an event does not have a rich internal structure. They sound odd as reponses to the question what happened? , e.g. Q. What happened? ???A. She liked the food (b) Activities versus events \u00b6 Activities do not have a natural end point (they are \"atelic\"). Events have a natural end point (they are \"telic\"). Examples of activities are run, walk, wash, work . Examples of events are break, collapse, crash, fall Because activities do not have a natural endpoint, they sound good when used with time expressions which imply an incomplete activity e.g. I've been walking for an hour (and I may continue to walk for another hour). By contrast events sound odd when used with such time expressions, e.g ${ }$ It collapsed for an hour. * Events sound good with time expressions which imply a complete activity, e.g. The bridge collapsed in five seconds . Activities do not sound good with such time expressions, e.g. ${ }$ He walked in five minutes* (c) Accomplishments versus achievements \u00b6 Achievements are instantaneous events, taking place in a very brief instant, while accomplishments can take place over an extended period of time. The linguistic term to descibe this phenomenon is \"durative\" (see table below). A durative event is one which is extended in time. Because Achievements are instantaneous / non-durative, they cannot be stopped in the middle, e.g. ? They stopped reaching the summit ? The balloon stopped popping This contrasts with Accomplishments which can be stopped in the middle, eg. She stopped jumping over the stairs They stopped building the house In addition, because Accomplishments are extended in time, we can use them with progressive grammatical aspect, while we cannot do this with Acheivements, e.g. They are building the house ? They are reaching the summit Dynamic (Rich internal structure) Durative (Occurs during prolonged period) Telic (Bounded) State - + - Activity + + - Accomplishment + + + Achievement - - + Summary of tests \u00b6 Definition test: States are relatively hard to define. What happened test: Doesn't sound good with States Present progressive (-ing form): States and Achievements do not sound good in the progressive \"for\" test: Activities sound good with a \"for\" expression, but not events. \"in\" test: Events sound good with \"in\" but not activities \"Stop\" test: Achievements do not sound good with \"stop\", e.g. she stopped reaching the top of the mountain Multiple lexical aspects \u00b6 Some verbs seem to have more than one lexical aspect I like cheese (STATE) She liked my post on facebook (i.e. pressed \"like\") (ACHIEVEMENT) I have a car (STATE) She's having a good time (ACTIVITY) I love that dress (STATE) I'm loving this book (ACTIVITY???) Be quiet. I'm thinking (ACTIVITY) I think you're really rude (STATE) So what's going on here? One possibility is that each verb has two different meanings corresponding to different lexical aspects. This is certainly the case for think ( thinking as an activity versus think =believe). With other verbs it's possibly to identify a primary meaning, and a secondary meaning which is an extension of the primary meaning, e.g. love = STATE -> loving = ACTIVITY. Some verbs can `shift' lexical aspect depending on sentence context; She's is dancing (ACTIVITY) She finally danced the tango (ACHIEVEMENT) The light is flashing (ACTIVITY, NB there is an `iterative' interpretation) The light flashed (ACHIEVEMENT) However, it is often possible to identify a `core', most frequently used lexical aspect. Exercise \u00b6 What is the lexical aspect of the following verbs? fly sing flatten paint cover suck flash Grammatical aspect \u00b6 Grammatical aspect refers to grammatical devices to signal one's perpsective on an event . In English there are two grammatical aspects: PROGRESSIVE and PERFECTIVE. The progressive (-ing form), signals an INTERNAL perspective on the event, while the perfective (-en form) signals an EXTERNAL perspective on the event, He is danc ing (PROGRESSIVE aspect) She is sing ing (PROGRESSIVE aspect) We are \"inside\" the event in the sense that the event continues up till the time of speaking, and will continue after the time of speaking. King Kong has fall en (PERFECTIVE aspect) I have brok en the chair (PERFECTIVE aspect) We are \"outside\" the event in the sense that the event is complete. Other languages have richer systems, e.g Spanish differentiates between the Imperfective and the Progressive. Tense is not aspect \u00b6 Students often confuse tense and aspect. Don't worry, this is normal, as these concepts are very closely related. Here are two sentences which demostrate the difference: By this time next week, I will have eaten all of the tins of baked beans in my cupboard This sentence uses the \"WILL\" FUTURE, but perfective aspect to express COMPLETION She was sleeping when the earthquake happened This sentence is in the PAST TENSE but uses progressive aspect to describe an ONGOING event. Combinations of tense, grammatical and lexical aspect \u00b6 Tense, grammatical and lexical aspect combine in weird and wonderful ways. This is a very complex system and we can only begin to scrape the surface. (a) Present tense and Activity/Accomplishment/Achievement verbs \u00b6 When present tense is used with Activities, Accomplishments and Achievements, we get a HABITUAL intepretation, e.g. She sings every day. He works in a call centre He smashes things (he's clumsy or aggressive) (b) Progressive grammatical aspect and achievement verbs \u00b6 This conveys an iterative interpretation (repeated events) The light is flashing He's flattening boxes Tense/aspect and SLT practice \u00b6 Children with SLI have difficulties marking tense, e.g. He went there -> Him go there However, this is a difficulty with the morphological expression of tense, rather than a difficulty understanding what tense means. Young children, when acquiring tense, conflate tense and aspect . They are more likely to mark paste tense on Achievement and Accomplishment verbs, because these tend to describe COMPLETED events. Some studies have argued that by manipulating the lexical aspect of verbs you can help children acquire tense (Van Horne, A. J. O., Fey, M., & Curran, M. (2017). Do the Hard Things First: A Randomized Controlled Trial Testing the Effects of Exemplar Selection on Generalization Following Therapy for Grammatical Morphology.

Clinical implications of the effects of lexical aspect and phonology on children\u2019s production of the regular past tense. Child Language Teaching and Therapy , 23 (3), 287\u2013306.) In fact, Van Horne et al. found that children with DLD were better at producing the past tense forms when trained on more difficult items! Some studies have found that language-impaired children have difficulties comprehending and producing grammatical aspect (Fletcher, P., Leonard, L. B., Stokes, S. F., & Wong, A. M. Y. (2005).

The balloon stopped popping This contrasts with Accomplishments which can be stopped in the middle, eg.

Young children, when acquiring tense, conflate tense and aspect . They are more likely to mark paste tense on Achievement and Accomplishment verbs, because these tend to describe COMPLETED events. Some studies have argued that by manipulating the lexical aspect of verbs you can help children acquire tense (Van Horne, A. J. O., Fey, M., & Curran, M. (2017).

Progressive aspect requires \"be\" as the agreeing auxiliary She is doing it Combining tense and aspect \u00b6 When combining tense and aspect we Mark aspect on the rightmost verb and insert an appropriate auxiliary verb Repeat last rule if necessary Mark tense (plus \u201dthe future\u201d) on the leftmost verb Aspect expresses the PERSPECTIVE. Tense expresses the VIEWPOINT (past / present / future), e.g. She has$ {PRES.~TENSE}$ eaten$ {PERF.~ASP}$ the food Perfective Aspect signals an EXTERNAL PERSPECTIVE on the event (the event is completed). Past tense shows that we adopt a PRESENT VIEWPOINT on the event. This is the \"Present Perfect\" and it is used when when a completed event has relevance for the present, e.g. I have eaten the food, and therefore I am full We 'll be$ {FUT.~TENSE}$ eating$ {PROG.~ASPECT}$ dinner when you arrive Progressive Aspect signals an INTERNAL PERSPECTIVE on the event (it is ongoing). Future tense shows that we adopt a FUTURE VIEWPOINT. This is the \"Future Progressive\" and it is used to describe an ongoing future event.

Most functions are defined in relation to the verb . 5 minute exercise \u00b6 Try to learn the following artificial language Gugo bikavit lamnok = 'The cat chased the dog' Lopo bikavit tunglish = 'The cat ate the food' Lopo gugo lamnok = 'The dog likes the food' What does the following sentence mean? Bikavit gugo tunglish How did you complete the artificial language learning task? You figured out that particular positions in the sentences had particular FUNCTIONS. e.g. Subject, Verb, Object. Functions and sentence position \u00b6 Obligatory functions - Subjects and Verbs \u00b6 Almost all sentences of English needs a Subject and a Verb [ Syntax $ {SUBJECT}$ ] rocks! $ {VERB}$ [ Madonna $ {SUBJECT}$ ] sings $ {VERB}$ [ That donkey $ {SUBJECT}$ ] kicks! $ {VERB}$ The Subject is often the do-er, e.g. Madonna is the person who sings, and the donkey is the thing that kicks. However, in the following sentence Breakfast is served Breakfast is not the do-er. This shows that functions express a relationship which is only loosely linked to meaning . Functions express syntactic relationships , and are more closely related to sentence position than meaning. For example, in English, the Noun Phrase which comes immediately before the verb is always the Subject. In many languages the formal relationship between subject and verb is expressed via agreement . This means that the form of the verb is linked to the type of subject, e.g. Person Singular Plural 1st (speaker) I sing We sing 2nd (addressee) You sing You sing 3rd (person outside the conversation) She sing-s They sing We can see that the English paradigm is very sparse. However, other languages have much richer verb agreement paradigms, e.g. Spanish and Latin. Functions which are \"chosen\" by the verb \u00b6 (a) Objects \u00b6 After the verb, we often (but not always) have an Object Syntax rocks [ my world! $_{OBJECT}$ ] Madonna sings [ catchy tunes $_{OBJECT}$ ] That donkey kicks [ people $_{OBJECT}$ ] These are \"chosen\" by the verb in the sense that only certain verbs can take objects. For example, after the verbs yawn and run we typically do not have objects, e.g. He yawned She ran These are called intransitive verbs. Some verbs take two objects, in which case we have a direct and an indirect object . Direct Object (Od in LARSP) Indirect Object (Oi in LARSP) Meaning The thing which changes location / possession, e.g. She gave the ball to Jack The thing which receives the transferred entity, e.g. She gave the ball to Jack ** Animacy Often inanimate Often animate Syntax Does not come after a preposition Often comes after a preposition Note that the Indirect Object is \"parasitic\" on the Direct Object in the sense that it needs a Direct Object in order to be realised; Janet gave [ a book $_{Direct~Object}$] Janet gave [ a book $ {Direct~Object}$]. [ to Mary $ {Indirect~Object}$ ] ?? Janet gave [ to Mary $_{Indirect~Object}$ ] For the following sentences, which are the direct and indirect objects? Albert showed Victoria his stamp collection Ennis brought a book for Angie Could you rustle me up an omellete? Patricia sent her friend a letter NB sometimes there is more than one option to realise direct versus indirect objects: Abdul sent Josh a letter (called the \"Double Object Dative\") Abdul sent a letter to Josh (called the \"Prepositional Dative\") Od and Oi are \"chosen\" by the verb, in the sense that there are particular verbs which tend to take two objects. Groups of verbs taking two objects are verbs of physical transfer ( give, take, receive, lend, borrow, deliver, donate, show ) and verbs of metaphorical transfer ( tell, explain ) (b) Subject and Object complements \u00b6 Subject Complements (Cs) are phrases which describe a property of the subject , while Object Complements (Co) describe a property of the object . Here are some examples: Jack is [ terrible at maths ] = Cs describing Subject Jack Ali appears [ troubled ] at the moment = Cs describing Subject Ali I consider him [ my best friend ] = Co describing Object him I want that bedroom [ cleaned ] by tomorrow = Co describing Object bedroom Genevieve painted her bedroom walls [ dark green ] = Co describing Object her bedroom walls The mechanic hammered the panel [ flat ] = Co describing Object the panel Note that while Subjects and Objects are realised as Noun Phrases, Subject and Object Complements can be realised in many ways, e.g. as Adjective Phrases (e.g. terrible at maths ), or as Prepositional Phrases, e.g. he ripped the paper [ into pieces ] . Here is a list of verbs which tend to take complements Verbs which can take subject complements The copula - is/are/was/were Verbs of appearance - seem, appear, look, e.g. she seems / looks / appears tired Verbs of perception - *feel, smell, sound, taste, e.g. the food smells / tastes funny Verbs of persistence - stay, remain, e.g. You must stay / remain calm Verbs which can take object complements : appoint, call, certify, consider, crown, declare, elect, find, hold, imagine, keep, like, make, name, prefer, proclaim, profess, pronounce, prove, report, send, think, turn Complements are less moveable than objects. For example, in (1) and (2) below, we can move the objects to the front of the sentence. But this is not the case for complements (3) and (4) Jack gave Peter the book -> The book was given to Peter by Jack Jack gave Peter the book -> Peter was given the book by Jack Jack resembles Paul -> * Paul is resembled by Jack Magda named her daughter Isobel -> * Isobel was named her daughter by Magda NB these types of sentences are all examples of \"the passive\" which will be covered next semester Optional modifying functions \u00b6 Post-modifiers and Adverbials \u00b6 In many cases, the verb determines the functions which we can use, e.g. sit cannot be used with an Object Noun Phrase. Jack sat $*$ Jack sat [ the chair $_{OBJECT NOUN PHRASE}$] All of the above functions are, more-or-less, \"chosen\" by the verb. However, there are two functions which are not \"chosen\" by the verb: Adverbial and Postmodifier. An adverbial is a phrase (consisting of either a single word, or a group of words) which (a) modifies the verb or the sentence, and (b) occupies a \"peripheral\" position in the sentence, i.e. at the very beginning or the very end, and (c) can occur in EITHER peripheral position (i.e. it can be placed either at the beginning or end) [ On Tuesday ] we should have a picnic [ in my opinion ] [ With a bit of luck ] we will have good weather [ from tomorrow ] Though luckily in the following sentence has precisely the same function as the Adverbial with a bit of luck it is not peripheral, and therefore we are not categorising it as an adverbial. It is a adverb coming inside the Verb Complex. We [ luckily had $_{VERB~COMPLEX}$] good weather While Adverbials modify the verb, or sentence, Postmodifiers modify the Noun. They come after the noun, e.g. The man [ with the red hat ] followed me down the street The dog [ that scratched me ] was a Border Collie Functions and morphology \u00b6 Case-marking \u00b6 The syntactic function of a word or phrase may impact on its morphology. This phenomenon is called case-marking . A word whose morphology demonstrates its syntactic function is said to be case-marked . In English, case-marking only applies to Pronouns: Subject form (called NOMINATIVE or SUBJECTIVE case) = I, you, he/she/it, we, you, they Od, Oi, Cs, Co form (called ACCUSATIVE or OBJECTIVE form) = Me, you, him/her/it, us, you. them We also apply the GENITIVE CASE (denoting possession) to Nouns, e.g. She scratched Anna's car. Other language have much richer case systems, e.g. with special forms for direct versus indirect objects, and the possibility of marking case on Nouns as well as pronouns. Functions and language impairments \u00b6 Language-impaired children \u00b6 Language-impaired children occasionally omit subjects. This is a pattern found in younger typically-development children (Grela 1997, 2003) (He) went there. They also have case-marking difficulties in subject position, often using the accusative case, instead, e.g. Him go there. They also fail to inflect the verb which results in a loss of Subject-Verb agreement (as shown above, correct form of the verb is goes ) LARSP framework \u00b6 This is a framework for assessing child language taught in Linguistics II. It is designed to determine the child's syntactic level. To perform a LARSP analysis, you must determine the complexity of syntactic functions, e.g. She likes it = Simple one-word subject and object The girl likes the boy = Two-word subject and object containing Determiner + Noun combination. 5 minute exercise \u00b6 What is wrong with the following sentences?

Direct Object (Od in LARSP) Indirect Object (Oi in LARSP) Meaning The thing which changes location / possession, e.g. She gave the ball to Jack The thing which receives the transferred entity, e.g. She gave the ball to Jack ** Animacy Often inanimate Often animate Syntax Does not come after a preposition Often comes after a preposition Note that the Indirect Object is \"parasitic\" on the Direct Object in the sense that it needs a Direct Object in order to be realised; Janet gave [ a book $_{Direct~Object}$] Janet gave [ a book $ {Direct~Object}$]. [ to Mary $ {Indirect~Object}$ ] ?? Janet gave [ to Mary $_{Indirect~Object}$ ] For the following sentences, which are the direct and indirect objects? Albert showed Victoria his stamp collection Ennis brought a book for Angie Could you rustle me up an omellete? Patricia sent her friend a letter NB sometimes there is more than one option to realise direct versus indirect objects: Abdul sent Josh a letter (called the \"Double Object Dative\") Abdul sent a letter to Josh (called the \"Prepositional Dative\") Od and Oi are \"chosen\" by the verb, in the sense that there are particular verbs which tend to take two objects. Groups of verbs taking two objects are verbs of physical transfer ( give, take, receive, lend, borrow, deliver, donate, show ) and verbs of metaphorical transfer ( tell, explain )","title":"(a) Objects"},{"location":"lecture%20notes/08%20-%20Syntactic%20Functions/#b-subject-and-object-complements","text":"Subject Complements (Cs) are phrases which describe a property of the subject , while Object Complements (Co) describe a property of the object .

Here is a list of verbs which tend to take complements Verbs which can take subject complements The copula - is/are/was/were Verbs of appearance - seem, appear, look, e.g. she seems / looks / appears tired Verbs of perception - *feel, smell, sound, taste, e.g. the food smells / tastes funny Verbs of persistence - stay, remain, e.g. You must stay / remain calm Verbs which can take object complements : appoint, call, certify, consider, crown, declare, elect, find, hold, imagine, keep, like, make, name, prefer, proclaim, profess, pronounce, prove, report, send, think, turn Complements are less moveable than objects. For example, in (1) and (2) below, we can move the objects to the front of the sentence. But this is not the case for complements (3) and (4) Jack gave Peter the book -> The book was given to Peter by Jack Jack gave Peter the book -> Peter was given the book by Jack Jack resembles Paul -> * Paul is resembled by Jack Magda named her daughter Isobel -> * Isobel was named her daughter by Magda NB these types of sentences are all examples of \"the passive\" which will be covered next semester","title":"(b) Subject and Object complements"},{"location":"lecture%20notes/08%20-%20Syntactic%20Functions/#optional-modifying-functions","text":"","title":"Optional modifying functions"},{"location":"lecture%20notes/08%20-%20Syntactic%20Functions/#post-modifiers-and-adverbials","text":"In many cases, the verb determines the functions which we can use, e.g. sit cannot be used with an Object Noun Phrase. Jack sat $*$ Jack sat [ the chair $_{OBJECT NOUN PHRASE}$] All of the above functions are, more-or-less, \"chosen\" by the verb. However, there are two functions which are not \"chosen\" by the verb: Adverbial and Postmodifier. An adverbial is a phrase (consisting of either a single word, or a group of words) which (a) modifies the verb or the sentence, and (b) occupies a \"peripheral\" position in the sentence, i.e. at the very beginning or the very end, and (c) can occur in EITHER peripheral position (i.e. it can be placed either at the beginning or end) [ On Tuesday ] we should have a picnic [ in my opinion ] [ With a bit of luck ] we will have good weather [ from tomorrow ] Though luckily in the following sentence has precisely the same function as the Adverbial with a bit of luck it is not peripheral, and therefore we are not categorising it as an adverbial. It is a adverb coming inside the Verb Complex. We [ luckily had $_{VERB~COMPLEX}$] good weather While Adverbials modify the verb, or sentence, Postmodifiers modify the Noun.

Always should be someone you really love. Apart from the main cause (\"We're looking for Girls\", \"Always should be someone\"), this has 6 dependent clauses with finite verbs: ...who are boys Who like boys to be girls Who do boys like they're girls Who do girls like they're boys. \u2026you really love We're going to be looking at these different types of clauses. Clinical relevance \u00b6 Language impaired individuals have particular difficulties comprehending and producing \"complex\" sentences Complex sentences are particularly important in educational and workplace settings. Other types of dependent clause \u00b6 Last week, we looked at adverbial clauses, these come inside an adverbial: [ When [ I fall in love ADVERBIAL.CLAUSE $]$ ADVERBIAL ] it will be forever Dependent clauses can come inside any other syntactic function (except the Verb Complex): S, Od, Oi, Cs, Co, and Pmod Dependent clauses as a complement of the verb (Od, Oi, Cs, Co) \u00b6 Od and Oi position \u00b6 Dependent clauses in Direct Object position Last night I dreamt [ (that) somebody loved me Od ] (the Smiths) I'll tell $[$ you Oi ] [ what I want Od ] (Spice Girls) I told [ you Oi ] [ I was ill Od ] (Spike Milligan's Epitaph) It may be easier to see that it is a Direct Object if you substitute it for the word \"something\" (the SOMETHING TEST!!) Last night I dreamt SOMETHING \u2192 somebody loved me. I told you SOMETHING \u2192 I was ill. I'll tell you SOMETHING \u2192 What I want. Cs and Co position \u00b6 Clauses can also come as Subject or Object Complement Money, that's [ what I want Cs ] (Barrett Strong - Old Motown Hit) I'll name [ this ship Od ] [ whatever I want Co ] (King Charles - (hungover)) Again, we can substitute the phrase with SOMETHING: Money, that's SOMETHING I'll name this ship SOMETHING Dependent clauses in Subject Position \u00b6 Here is an example of a dependent clause in subject position [ That she passed the exam S ] surprised her teacher. However, it sounds a bit weird. It would be much more natural to say to move the long Subject to the end and replace it with a dummy/expletive \"it\": It surprised her teacher [ that she passed the exam ] Why does this happen? In English we do not like very long phrases ar the beginning of a sentence. Here is another example I feel _ about weddings [ the way cats feel about waterslides ] (Nell Frizelle, Guardian) The phrase \"the way cats feel about waterslides\" has moved from its initial position (shown by the underscore): I feel [ the way cats feel about waterslides ] about weddings. But this just doesn't work!! Some researchers have suggested that there is a cross-linguistic tendency to shift long phrases to the end of a sentence to \"save the difficult things till last\". However, some languages seem to like long phrases at the front (Japanese). Dependent clauses in Post-modifer Position \u00b6 A postmodifier is a phrase which comes after a noun and modifies it. I found the book [ under the sofa ] I saw a man [ with the wooden leg ] Clauses can also come in postmodifier position She never gave me a reason [ why she arrived late ] I didn't believe Giles' claim [ that Geoff ate the chocolate cake ] I found the book [ that was under the sofa ] I saw a man [ who had a wooden leg ] The final two examples are \"relative\" clauses. Focus on relative clauses \u00b6 Girls who are boys... \u00b6 This is the type of clause that appears in the chorus of Girls and Boys: (We're) Looking for Girls who are boys Who like boys to be girls Who do boys like they're girls Who do girls like they're boys . Always should be someone you really love. The restrictive / non-restrictive distinction \u00b6 These are \"restrictive\" relative clauses. They take a set of entities, and restrict them to those entities with a specific property. e.g. \"girls who are boys\" is a subset of \"girls\". We can also use non-restrictive relative clauses, which just provide extra information. The Paris which is in Texas is warmer than the Paris which is in France (restrictive relative clauses) Paris, which is the capital of France , is a lovely city (non-restrictive relative clauses) Properties of relative clauses \u00b6 (a) Summary of properties Relative clauses have a number of interesting properties. They are headed by a relative pronoun (who, that, which). The can contain unusual word orders (e.g. There's the cat$ {OBJ}$ I$ {SUB}$ saw$_{VERB}$ ) They can split Subjects from Verbs (b) The relative pronoun The word which introduces the relative clause ( that, which, who ) is best described as a Pronoun. Why? She likes her : Pronouns are marked for CASE. She likes it : Pronouns are marked for ANIMACY DISTINCTION Now let's look at case-marking in relative pronouns: There's the man who saw him There's the man whom he saw And the animacy distinction There's the man who I saw. I found the money that I dropped. Occasionally the relative pronoun can be omitted: I found the money (that) I dropped The rules for this are slightly complicated. We can imagine the relative pronoun as \"moving\" to the front of the relative clause: He saw him -> There's the man whom he saw. (c) Unusual word orders When the relative pronoun refers to the OBJECT, we have an unusual (OSV) word order: There's the man who Obj. I Subj. saw V There's the fish that that Obj. she Subj. ate V (d) Splitting subjects from verbs If relative clauses come in the middle of sentences they can split Subjects from Verbs The man [ who I saw ] was happy This makes sentences with centre-embedded relative clauses particularly hard to process. Relative clauses in research \u00b6 Relative clauses are very widely used in linguistic research because: They vary in interesting ways across languages In some languages they allow you create simple and complex versions of the same sentence WITHOUT MAKING ANY CHANGES TO THE WORDS IN THE SENTENCE e.g. There's the cat that chased the dog / There's the dog that the cat chased This is incredibly useful because we can control for lexical factors and sentence length, while focusing on syntactic complexity. They are very sensitive to overall linguistic ability. Language impaired individuals find relative clauses particularly difficult to process.","title":"14 - Other types of dependent clause"},{"location":"lecture%20notes/16%20-%20Other%20types%20of%20dependent%20clauses/#14-other-types-of-dependent-clause","text":"","title":"14 - Other types of dependent clause"},{"location":"lecture%20notes/16%20-%20Other%20types%20of%20dependent%20clauses/#homework","text":"(We're) Looking for Girls who are boys Who like boys to be girls Who do boys like they're girls Who do girls like they're boys.
