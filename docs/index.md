# Linguistics Handbook Introduction

## What's in this handbook

The handbook contains the lecture notes to accompany the linguistics lectures. The lecture notes are also on canvas, and this handbook is not designed to replace Canvas materials.

## Why have this website in addition to Canvas?

I have created these notes using a platform called `mkdocs` which adds a couple of useful features.

Firstly, the **search capabilities** are really good. If you press `s` on your computer a search bar will appear. Type anything into it, e.g. `preposition` or `lemma` and it will quickly find the location where these topics are covered. This should be useful for revision.

Secondly, it contains a useful feature called a **permalink**. If you hover next to a heading, you will see a RETURN character (&#182;). Click on this, and the heading will move to the top of the screen. You will notice that the "url" (i.e. the address in the address  bar at the top of your browser) has changed. You can copy this address, and paste it into the app you are using to take your notes in (that is, if you are using an app, rather than pen and paper). Whenever, you want to quickly access the notes, just click on the link, and it will take you to the relevant location in the notes.

## How can I convert this material into notes which I can edit

Just copy the entire page, and paste it into your note taking app. You will see the Table of Contents printed at the top, but besides this quirk, the notes should look the same as they do on this website.

## What if I don't find this website useful

Just ignore it! It is not a replacement for Canvas, and all key materials are on canvas.
