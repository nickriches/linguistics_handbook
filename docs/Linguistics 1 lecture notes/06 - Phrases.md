# 06 - Phrases

## Yoda-speak

Yoda's language is created by moving groups of words. But we cannot move just any group of words. The words we can move must constitute a 'phrase': a group of words which go together.

(i) [Powerful] you have become _ . [The dark side] I sense _ in you.

NB We can't say *[Have become powerful you] have _* , or *[Side] I sense in you the dark _*

(ii) [Mourn them] do not _ . [Miss them] do not _ . Attachment leads to Jealousy.

(iv) If once you start down the dark path, [forever] will it dominate your destiny _ , [consume you] it will _ , as it did Obi-Wan's apprentice

(v) No. Not yet. One thing remains. Vader. You must confront Vader. Then, only then, [a Jedi] you will be _ . And [confront him] you will _.

## Phrases

So far we have looked at words and morphemes. Now we are going to combine these into units called 'phrases'

A phrase is a __group of words which behaves like a single single unit.__ The phrase tends to takes its name from the word which expresses the meaning of the phrase, e.g.

(i) Jack saw [a fascinating TV programme] -> Phrase is about a programme, _programme_ is a noun, therefore it is a NOUN PHRASE

(ii) Rufus likes drinking beer [in his local pub] -> Phrase is about a location, the location is expressed by the preposition, therefore this is a PREPOSITIONAL PHRASE.

Phrases are also sometimes referred to as **constituents**

## Tests for Phrasehood

The groups of words which form a phrase may for a **syntactic**, **semantic**, or **phonological** unit

### Syntactic tests for phrasehood

First three are most reliable.

1. **Replacement test**

   A phrase can be replaced with 'placeholder' expression (e.g. a pronoun)

   (a) [Elliot <sub>NOUN PHRASE</sub>] loved [the cute green alien <sub>NOUN PHRASE</sub>] -> [He] loved [it]

   (b) Elliot [hugged the cute green alien <sub>VERB PHRASE</sub>] and Gertie [did so <sub>VERB PHRASE</sub>] too (and [so did <sub>VERB PHRASE</sub>] Gertie)

2. **Question test**

   A phrase can be questioned

   (a) Who did Elliot love? [ The cute green alien <sub>NOUN PHRASE</sub>]

   (b) Where did Elliot find ET? [ In the toolshed <sub>PREPOSITIONAL PHRASE</sub> ]

   (c) What is Elliot doing? [Hugging the cute green alien <sub> VERB PHRASE </sub>]

3. **Standalone test**

   When questioned, the phrase can stand alone as an answer (see above)

4. **Coordination test**

   Phrases may be coordinated, i.e. they may be produced in a series linked by a coordinator (_and_, _but_, _or_) e.g.

   (a) [Elliot **and** Gertie <sub>NOUN PHRASE</sub>] loved [the cute green alien **and** the soft brown Teddy <sub>NOUN PHRASE</sub>]

   (b) Elliot [hugged the cute green alien **and** cuddled the soft brown Teddy <sub>VERB PHRASE</sub>]

5. **Movement test**

   Phrases may, under circumstances move. If we attempt to move a group of words which is not a phrase, the sentence sound ungrammatical. Yoda (above) speak provides plenty of examples of the movement test, e.g.

   (a) [Mourn them] do not _ . (Movement of Verb Phrase)

   (b) [Consume you] it will _ . (Movement of Verb Phrase)

   (c) [The dark side] I sense _ in you. (Movement of Noun Phrase)

   (d) [Forever] it will dominate your destiny _ (Movement of Adverb Phrase. NB phrases can be single words. We can turn this into a multi-word phrase: *For the rest of time....*)

6. **Omission test**

   Some phrases may be omitted. If a group of words may be omitted, it is likely to be a phrase, e.g. _The man (in the moon) came down (too soon)_ (omission of prepositional phrase, and adverb phrase).

   This test is probably the weakest test, as not all phrases may be omitted.

7. **Filler test**

   Fillers are words which we use to 'fill in' pauses. We tend to use them to 'cover up' disfluences. A classic example is 'like'. In general, fillers cannot be inserted within phrases, e.g.

   1. Elliot, *like*, loved the cute green alien (*like* inserted between phrases - sounds okay)
   2. ? Elliot loved the, *like*, cute green alien (*like* inserted within the Noun Phrase - sounds odd.)

To remember these tests learn the following acronym: Really Quick Snakes Can Make Orangutans Flee

### Semantic tests for phrasehood

The phrase is about a single thing. That thing is expressed by the 'head' of the phrase.

1. I stepped in [a large heap of dung]
2. They played a game of basketball [in the park]
3. He is [good at playing chess]
4. Jack can run [really quickly]

For the above sentences (a) what is the phrase about? (b) identify the head of the phrase? (c) what kind of phrase is it?

### Phonological tests for phrasehood

The sentence sounds odd if we insert a pause within a phrase, e.g.

1. ? Elliot loved the, *PAUSE*, cute green alien

### What to do about the verb?

According to the coordination test, replacement test, and the movement test, the verb is part of a bigger phrase consistent of the verb and following Noun Phrases, e.g.

1. Patrick [loved the fish **but** hated the chips <sub>VERB PHRASE</sub>]
2. Mary [loved the mousse <sub>VERB PHRASE</sub>], and Shania [did so <sub>VERB PHRASE</sub>] too.
3. [Mourn them <sub>VERB PHRASE</sub>] do not _ . [Miss them <sub>VERB PHRASE</sub>] do not _ . Attachment leads to Jealousy.

Notice that auxiliary verbs (and negative particles) are not part of the Noun Phrase (*[Mourn them <sub>VERB PHRASE</sub>] **do** not, [Eaten them <sub>VERB PHRASE</sub>] she **has** _* ).

But the Noun Phrases which come after the verb are also phrases. Therefore we have **phrases inside phrases!**

1. Patrick [ loved [ the fish <sub>NOUN PHRASE</sub>] <sub>VERB PHRASE</sub> ]

This hierarchical structure (phrases-inside-phrases) is often expressed using syntactic trees (see lecture example)

**BE WARNED THAT DIFFERENT RESEARCH FIELDS USE THE TERM "VERB PHRASE" DIFFERENTLY**

Many clinicians and speech and language scientists use the term "Verb Phrase" to refer to the Verb and all associated words, e.g. *Mary **is greedily eating** the food*. This is also the definition which David Crystal uses. However, we will be using the definition preferred by linguists: the main verb and following Noun Phrases. This is because this unit meets the tests for phrasehood described above.
