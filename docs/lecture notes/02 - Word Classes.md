# 02 - Word classes

## Definition

Working definition is 'Minimal Independent Symbolic Unit' (MISU)

#### Minimal

This means that words cannot be divided into smaller standalone units

1. Inactive -> *One sip of coffee and Charles changes from **in-** to hyper-**active**.
2. Underconfident -> ?After eight pints, Angela changes from **under-** to over-**confident**. 
3. Walk out -> She **walked** through the door and **out** of my life.
4. Blackbird (species) -> *She saw a **black** and a white **bird** in the tree
5. Black magic -> ?The witch practises both **black** and white **magic**

#### Independent

This property can be defined in a couple of ways:

(a) Words are interpretable in isolation, e.g.

1. A: What was he doing? B: Working
2. B: How would you describe the experience? B: Unbelievable
3. Shark!!!!!!!!
4. Swim!!!!!!!!!

(b) Words can move around the sentence, e.g.

1. The **dog** chased the cat
2. The cat chased **the dog**
3. He loves being with his **dog**

#### Symbolic

This means that there is an **arbitrary** relationship between **form** and **function** (or **sound** and **meaning**)

To test this, we can take a single concept, and look at words to describe this concept across languages. The words will have very different sound properties.

The property of symbolism was listed by the linguist Charles Sanders Pierce (1839 - 194) as a key defining property of human languages

### A dirty secret - there is no adequate definition of a word

All of the properties which are used to define a word: minimality, independence, and symbolism, are in fact gradable.

For example *black magic* is weakly minimal as when the two units are separate it sounds ever so slightly odd, e.g. ?The witch practises both **black** and white **magic**

Independence is also highly gradable. Both *mood* and *tizz* occur with similar meanings in the phrase, *He is in a mood / tizz*. But only *mood* can easily move around a sentence, e.g. *His mood was dark*. Moroever, if someone were to say *tizz* in isolation and ask you if it's a word you might find this difficult. You would probably say "yes" on the basis that it occurs in the phrase *in a tizz* but you would need to think carefully about this.

Some types of word classes lack independence, e.g. determiners such as *the*.

Finally, symbolism is also gradient. There is lots of interesting work demonstrating that sound symbolism is quite widespread in the world's languages. For example, words referring to rough textures tend to contain an trilled /r/ sound.

So when in clinic you are analysing a sentence, and you're deciding to determine whether a lexical unit is a real word, there may not be a perfect yes/no answer!

## Word classes

Words belong to word classes / syntactic categories

The word class determines how we put words together to make sentences

### Semantic definitions - why the don't work very well

Typical examples:

A verb is a DOING word
An adjective is a DESCRIBING word

But are the following adjectives or verbs?

1. The _raging_ river tore through the valley
2. That film really _sucks_

These examples demonstrate that semantic/functional definitions of words fall short

### 3 ways to define word classes

(a) Semantics / meaning-based test, e.g. a verb is a 'doing' word.

(b) Morphological test, e.g. we can make a verb progressive by adding _-ing_

(c) Positional test, e.g. verbs come after subjects and before objects, e.g. _she_ __ate__ _the fish_, _she_ __likes__ _cheese_.

### So which test?

The positional test is the most reliable, e.g.

1. The _raging_ river tore through the valley: _raging_ comes before a noun. It is an adjective
2. That film really _sucks_: comes after the subject _film_. It is a verb.

## Let's meet the word classes!

### Categorization of word classes

1. Content versus function words
   - Content words = Nouns, Verbs, Adjectives, Adverbs (in Speech and Language Therapy, these are sometimes called 'information-carrying words')
   - Function words = Determiners, Pronouns, Prepositions (and maybe certain types of verbs, we will come to this later)
2. Open versus closed class. Open class words permit new members, while closed class words don't. NB all content words are open, and all function words are closed.
   - Open = Nouns, Verbs, Adjectives, Adverbs
   - Closed = Determiners, Pronouns, Prepositions.
3. What the words do in the sentence?
   - Referring words = Nouns, Pronouns
   - Modifying words = Adjectives and Adverbs
4. Where do they appear in the sentence?
   - The verb complex tends to contain auxiliary verbs and adverbs in addition to the verb itself
   - The Noun Phrase tends to contain determiners and adjectives in addition to the noun itself
   - Prepositions are used before the Noun Phrase.
5. Super- and sub-types
   - Types of modifying words: adjectives and adverbs
   - Types of referring words (nominals): Nouns and Pronouns

## Word classes and language impairment

Children with language impairments

- Tend to miss out function words
- Have difficulties understanding prepositions (when used to express location), e.g. _on_, _in_
- Have reduced verb diversity
- Sometimes omit arguments of the verb, e.g. 'She put the books'

## 5 minutes exercise

What's unusual about the following sentence: "That film was absobloodylutely brilliant!"?

A student says 'I am going to a lection'. What does 'lection' mean, and how has this error arisen?
