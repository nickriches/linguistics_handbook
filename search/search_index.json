Roediger and Karpicke (2006) tested students' learning of information in short passages about scientific topics. They varied the degree to which individuals were tested on their knowledge by giving them a blank sheet of paper, and asking them to recall as much information as possible. The results are shown below</p> <p></p> <p>We can see that while conditions involving lots of Study (SSSS, SSST) led to better retention after five minutes, the conditions involving lots of testing led to better retention after an interval of 1 week. The moral of the story is that \"cramming\" works, to an extent, but leads to very poor retention.</p> <p>The effect whereby repeated self-testing leads to better learning is called the \u201ctesting effect\u201d, and a learning strategy which depends on continually testing yourself is called \u201ctest-enhanced\u201d learning. Amazingly, there is good evidence that the very act of testing yourself is beneficial, even if you do not successfully recall the relevant information (Kornell et al., 2015; Kornell &amp; Vaughn, 2016; Vaughn et al., 2017). This is pretty extraordinary and suggests that time spent studying at your desk is never wasted, even if you are struggling to recall the material.</p> <p>The way that you test yourself depends on the material you are learning. For example, if testing new words in a foreign language you could have a card with the word in your first language (e.g. English) on one side, and the word in the target language (e.g. French) on the other side. You can work your way through the pack, read the English word, try to recall the French word, and test your knowledge by turning over the card. You could also do this process in reverse, e.g. look at the French word, and try to translate this into English.</p> <p>The more active we are in the way we test ourselves, the better we learn and retain the information. Regarding the flashcard example above, the more active form of learning is to read the English word, and try to recall the French word. However, though the alternative process, translating from French to English is less active, it may be beneficial in certain contexts, e.g. for quick revision.</p> <p>Some forms of learning are much more abstract not amenable to flashcards. An example of this is your understanding of the word class Noun. You could revise this in a variety of ways, e.g.</p> <p>-    Provide a definition, but with a word missing, e.g.</p> <p><code>A Noun is word which often refers to a ___ (thing). It is often preceded by a ___ (Determiner)</code></p> <p>-    Create a multiple choice question, e.g. In the following sentence, which of the following properties does not describe a Noun</p> <ul> <li>It takes the suffix -ing \u2714</li> <li>It takes the suffix -s (in the regular form)</li> <li>It is often prceded by a detrminer</li> </ul> <p>-    Create an open-ended \u201clist\u201d question, e.g. \u201cList three properties of a Noun\u201d (Possible answers: it tends to refer to a thing, it inflects for plural, e.g. horses, it comes after a determiner, e.g. the horse, it \u201cagrees\u201d with a verb, e.g. the horse runs, the horses run_ etc.)</p> <p>-    Create a completely open-ended question, e.g. \u201cWhat is a definition of a noun\u201d?</p> <p>Which of these you think promotes more active learning? Evidence suggests that the more open-ended questions lead to better learning because they involve active recall of the material rather than recognition of the right answer (Kang et al., 2007). This doesn\u2019t mean that multiple-choice questions are bad for study \u2013 they can be very beneficial. For example, there are clear right or wrong answers, unlike open-ended questions, and this can help you decide whether you need to revise a particular topic. They are also less time-consuming than open-ended questions. A good revision strategy would probably contain a mix of different types of revision prompts, e.g. flashcards, multiple-choice questions, open-ended list questions, and completely open-ended questions.</p>"},{"location":"how_to_learn/#why-note-taking-is-a-key-skill","title":"Why note-taking is a key skill","text":"<p>Words are concrete and easy to test using flashcard systems. For other kinds of knowledge, e.g. abstract theories, flashcards are too crude and simplistic, so you\u2019ll need to find other ways to test yourself. For example, you could write the key claims of the theory on a piece of paper, number these, and using the numbers as prompts try to recall each claim one by one. This kind of works, but it is clear that the more abstract and complex a knowledge domain becomes, the more difficult it is to think of ways to test yourself.</p> <p>While you are thinking about clever procedures to test yourself on everything you need to know, just start taking some notes. Take a blank sheet of paper, or open up a note-taking app, and try to recall everything you need to know in note form. By taking notes you are having to actively recall and process the information you have learnt. For example, because you are incapable of rapidly writing down everything the lecturer says (unless you are a word-record typist or short-hand expert), you are having to identify the most important points when notetaking. Also, because human memory for linguistic form is generally weaker than our memory for linguistic meaning, you will have to write down the main points of the lecture in your own words, and in this way you are having to actively process the information.</p> <p>An additional benefit of note-taking is that you can easily show the structure of the material you are learning using headings and subheadings. All of the material you learn will have some kind of structure, e.g. a theory might consist of three key arguments, and the ICF clinical framework consists of four areas of functioning. Lectures themselves will be organised into discrete sections. Moreover, there is evidence to suggest that information is more adequately processed and retained when it is explicitly integrated into a larger structure. For example the regular use of headings and subheadings in written passages helps the reader to read more quickly and accurately, and recall more information (Hy\u00f6n\u00e4 &amp; Lorch, 2004; Lorch &amp; Lorch, 1996; Sanchez et al., 2001).</p> <p>However, while the information you are given fits into an overarching structure, the technology which is used to deliver lectures is not great for showing structure. Powerpoint does not show structure very well, as it invites the user to create a continuous chain of slides. Sometimes lecturers add \u201cTable of Contents\u201d slides, but this is not that widely practised. By making notes you can actually impose structure on the material you are learning, using headings and subheadings, and this will help you to learn that material.</p>"},{"location":"how_to_learn/#the-cornell-note-taking-system","title":"The Cornell note-taking system","text":"<p>A good tried and tested note-taking system is called \u201cCornell Notes\u201d, which was devised by  Prof. Walter Pauk of Cornell University in the 1950s. This implements test-enhanced learning via a column on the left hand side of the page. In this column you write the cues which you need in order to test your learning. You just cover your notes with your right hand and use the cues in the left-hand column to try to remember the material.</p> <p></p> <p>If you do an internet search you will find loads of materials on this approach. Here is one link to start you off.</p>"},{"location":"how_to_learn/#why-writing-notes-on-slides-may-not-be-helpful","title":"Why writing notes on slides may not be helpful","text":"<p>Lecturers often supply their students with handouts containing the slides. Many students write on these handouts, and believe that this is an appropriate way to learn. But what is the evidence that this is a good learning approach? Existing studies investigating the impact of slide-based handouts have found that students learn better without them (Kim, 2018; Worthington &amp; Levasseur, 2015).</p> <p>Why might this be the case? Firstly, if the slides contain a substantial amount of text, you are less likely to convert what you have learnt into your own words. Your notes will become shorter. They will become comments on the slides, rather than a full paraphrase of what you have just heard. Consequently, you will be learning in a more passive manner. Secondly, as mentioned above, it is quite difficult to signpost structure within slides. By contrast, if you make notes on a blank piece of paper it is easier to show structure by writing your own subheadings.</p>"},{"location":"how_to_learn/#so-i-just-need-to-make-good-notes","title":"So, I just need to make good notes?","text":"<p>Yes, good note-taking is the place to start, but you also need to explore other ways to test yourself. As mentioned, flashcards may be very useful. For example, for anatomy, you could have a picture of a part of the body on one side, and the label on the other. You can look at the picture, and then attempt to recall the label. If you are correct, put it in the correct pile, and if you are incorrect, or cannot recall it, put it in the incorrect pile. There is quite interesting evidence to suggest that if you correctly recall something once, you are likely to recall it successfully in the future (Bahrick et al., 1993). Therefore, you can learn very efficiently just by repeatedly testing yourself on the items in the incorrect pile. Also, make sure that, when you test yourself, you do it at fairly widely-spaced intervals. This principle is known as \u201cdistributed learning\u201d or the \u201cspacing effect\u201d, and there is a lot of evidence that it is beneficial for learning in an academic setting (Dempster, 1988).</p> <p>Naturally, flashcards are only amenable to certain kinds of topics.

Its first usage was in the term hardcore to describe a material for road suracing. Core had a literal meaning to describe the material underneath the tarmac. Then it was used to describe very aggressive punk music, characterised by a very dedicated and fanatical fanbase. Then the term emocore came along. Emo refers to a genre of rock music which is associated with certain types of emotion, e.g. sadness, sensitivity and introspection, and the -core suffix took on the meaning of having a dedicated and fanatical fanbase. However, this is arguably ironic, as emocore fans were relatively passive compared to their punk counterparts. After this, -core became used as a general term to denote an artistic movement, first, mumblecore (films from the early nineties following the lives of intelligent, arty and nihilistic twenty-year olds, and usually starring Greta Gerwig), and now cottagecore, i.e. genre of fashion characterised by wearing old-fashioned floral countrified clothes. The core example is interesting as it shows how a literal meaning (foundation for a road) turned into a figurative meaning (dedication to an artistic movement), which then morphed over time, and became gradually more ironic.</li> <li>-tifa morpheme. This comes from the word antifa used to describe anti-fascist protesters.

This context encompasses who said the utterances, how the utterance was being used in a conversation, and whether there are any intentions behind the utterance. In other words, the utterances is a specific sentence produced in a particular context, at a particular moment, by a particular speaker.</p> <p>Here are two examples to demonstrate this difference</p> <ol> <li>The bin is full</li> </ol> <p>Its explicit meaning is merely the proposition that THE BIN IS FULL.

The explicit / encoded meaning of \"The starters were good\" is the proposition that THE STARTERS WERE GOOD. This is truth-conditional as it is capable of being true or false (depending on whether the starters were good). However, the inference that the rest of the meal wasn't very nice is not truth-conditional, because we can see that it can be cancelled by the speaker (B).

An example of a simple inference is reference assignment, e.g. \"Have you met John? He's my best friend.'\" We are most likely to infer that he refers to John because it is the most recently mentioned Noun Phrase. However, it could feasibly refer to a different entity. An example of a complex inference is figurative language such as metaphor. When Princess Diana spoke about her close relationship with her butler, Paul Burrell, she referred to him as \"her rock\", i.e. someone she could depend on. However, in a different context, it may mean something completely different, e.g. if someone says \"you are like a rock\" to their romantic partner, it probably means they are being cold, distant and withdrawn (NB technically this is simile, but it is closely related to metaphor). Metaphor is much more complex than reference-assignment as it involves making connections between literal and nonliteral meanings.</p> <p>In addition, to covering a wide range of phenomena, the term \"pragmatics\" means different things to different people. When linguists use the term they tend to refer to \"linguistic pragmatics\", i.e. the process o interpreting utterances in context using linguistic inference. However, it is also used to describe someone's general communicative / conversational ability, e.g. their ability to use turn-taking, their ability to create coherent discourses (i.e. they don't suddenly switch topic).

Austin in his 1962 book \"How to do things with words.\" It was one of the first pragmatic theories to address the issue of intention recognition. According to his approach we \"do things\" with sentences, e.g. we say sentences to warn, inform, or persuade. The thing we do with the sentence is the speech act or illocution. There is a finite list of possible speech acts, which makes the task of identifying the appropriate illocution much easier.</p> <p>We can determine the speech act of a sentence if we paraphrase it using a performative verb (a verb which expresses the speech act), e.g.</p> <ol> <li>Would you like to come to the party? \u2192\u00a0The speaker is inviting the addressee to come to a party.</li> </ol> <p>Interpreting the speech act involves paraphrasing the sentence using a performative verb. This is the performative hypothesis. (NB sometimes the performative verb may be explicitly stated, e.g. \"I would like to invite you to the party\" but most of the time the performative verb is left implicit).</p> <p>Austin conceptualises the utterance on three different levels. In the middle is the speech act or illocution. This proceeds from the locution (the explicit / truth-conditional meaning of the utterance). There is also a level the perlocution which is the general (as opposed to specific) goal of the utterance and its overall effect on the listener. Here is an example for the utterance I'll tidy my room:</p> Level Name Definition Description 1 Locution Explicit content The speaker will tidy their room at some point in the future 2 Illocution (or Speech Act) What the speaker \"does\" with the utterance He PROMISED he would tidy his room 3 Perlocution General goal and overall effect on listener The child wants to impress their parents (and maybe increase the probability that they will be allowed to watch a horror film) <p>According to Austin, illocutions / speech acts are chosen from a finite list. Here is list he proposed: Greeting, Promise, Congratulation, Threat, Question (aka \u2018request for information\u2019), Comment, Offer, Attention getter, Request, Command. He referred to the last three as directives.</p> <p>The choice of speech act will depend on the context. e.g. the sentence \"There is some cake on the table\" could be, a complaint to the waiter in a caf\u00e9, a warning not to let the dog into the room where the cake is, an invitation to take some of the cake, an accusation made against a fridge-raiding teenager.</p>"},{"location":"Linguistics%202%20lecture%20notes/01%20-%20Pragmatics%201/#felicity-conditions","title":"Felicity conditions","text":"<p>To help choose the appropriate speech act, each carries a set of felicity conditions, i.e. conditions which need to be met for the speech act to acheive its purpose (perlocution), e.g.</p> Sentence Speech act Felicity conditions I pronounce you man and wife An act of \"marrying\" The person who says this must have the relevant authority I'm so sorry An apology The apology must be genuine and heartelt (e.g. compare with an ironic apology: \"I'm so SOH-ree!\") Come to a party!

His approach is sometimes called \"Grice's Maxims\". These are broad guidelines for cooperative behaviour. The maxims are subsumed by an overarching principle called the Cooperative Principle. Grice summarises this as follows: \u201cMake your conversational contribution such as is required, at the stage at which it occurs, by the accepted purpose or direction of the talk exchange in which you are engaged\u201d Grice (1975). In conversation, speakers tend to cooperate and assume that the other person is cooperating. So there is a mutual assumption of cooperation. There is also an assumption that if someone is cooperating they are following the conversational maxims / Grice's maxims. These are more specific versions of the cooperative principle.</p> <p>The maxims are as follows:</p> <ol> <li>Maxim of quality: \u2018Be truthful\u2019Try to make your contribution one that is true.Do not say that which you believe to be false.Do not say that for which you lack adequate evidence.</li> <li>Maxim of quantity: 'Be brief'Make your contribution as informative as is required (for the current purposes of the exchange). Do not make your contribution more informative than is required.Example: A: I don't have a pen. B: Peter's got one. Peter may have ten pens, but if B were to respond Peter's got ten, this would be overly informaive.</li> <li>Maxim of manner: 'Be brief'Make your contribution as informative as is required (for the current purposes of the exchange). Do not make your contribution more informative than is required.</li> <li>Maxim of relation: 'Be clear'Make your contributions relevant. Be perspicuous (ie clear, lucid).Avoid ambiguity.
